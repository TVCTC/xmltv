    <desc lang="en">In the world of space dealing everyone is having money trouble. Larry gets the offer of a lifetime: a Soviet era space suit. But there’s a problem – the price tag. To be in with a chance he has to clear stock and raise some dough. Torie pays big for an Apollo 11 artefact but it’s not what it seems – has she thrown away $10,000? And Cole meets Apollo 7 legend Walt Cunningham who shares memories of his time in space. Cole has money to spend – what he wants to know is will Walt part with any of his space items?
