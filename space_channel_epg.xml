But Larry, Cole and Torie don’t have tickets.  So when one comes up for grabs they do what they do best – they face off in a space dealing competition: whoever makes the most money before the big night wins.  Torie stakes her reputation on an Apollo 17 map used on the surface of the moon; Larry gets his hands on a one-of-a-kind Skylab prototype; and Cole acquires a mysterious homing beacon – could it be a relic from an Apollo mission?  To make big money and win the ticket Cole has to turn detective. Duration: 3600</desc>
