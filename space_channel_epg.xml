    <title lang="en">Near Death Spacewalk Experience</title>
    <desc lang="en">On July 16, 2013, the Italian Luca Parmitano nearly drowned in his own helmet during an outing outside the space station. In this dark, silent environment, this astronaut has seen his entire life pass by before his eyes for a moment. According to him, he came close to death. After a few minutes of work, the Italian felt something strange at the level of his neck. Water entered his wetsuit, but he didn't know where it came from. He informed his colleague and Houston of this small problem and was ordered to return to the decompression chamber. Unfortunately on the way back, the volume of the liquid increased. The top of his helmet was flooded. His earphones were wet, which could have deprived him of any contact with others. Her vision, too, was altered and the risk of drowning was imminent. Luckily, he managed to keep his mouth out of the water, which saved him. Duration: 721</desc>
