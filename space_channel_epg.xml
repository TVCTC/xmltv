The spectacular audiovisual concert will be held on Saturday, November 7, 2015, at Benaroya Hall in Seattle. (astrobioconcert.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
Glenna Burmer composed the original score, which was recorded at Bastyr Chapel with David Sabee as conductor and the NW Sinfonia Orchestra. She initially conceptualized the stages of evolution of our Universe using a combination of originally created video, licensed imagery and public domain images from the great astronomy organizations, including NASA, the Hubble telescope, IRFU-CEA, ESO, ESA, JPL, and many others. CGI animation of the colliding Universes before the Big Bang, the Laniakea sequence (a collaboration between Deep Sky Studios and Daniel Pomarede, IRFU-CEA, France), and video post-production effects were by Deep Sky Studios. The video and concert are produced by Burmer Music, LLC, copyright 2015. Duration: 653</desc>

    <title lang="en">Unidentified - Our Biological Universe</title>
    <desc lang="en">What we perceive as reality, is a product of our consciousness.  An external reality, if it existed, would by definition have to exist in the framework of space and time. But space and time are not independent realities but rather tools of the human and animal mind. Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined (different sides of the same coin that cannot be separated). The behavior of sub atomic particles (all particles and objects) is inextricably linked to the presence of a conscious observer.  without a conscious observer, they (at best) exist in an undetermined state of probability wave. Without consciousness, matter dwells in an undetermined state of probability.  any universe preceding consciousness, only existed in a probability state. The very structure of the universe is explainable only through biocentrism.  The Universe is finely tuned to support an observer, which makes sense because  life creates the universe, not the other way around.  it is simply the complete spacial temporal logic of the self. Time does not have a real existence outside of animal sense perception.  it is the process by which we perceive changes in the universe. Space, like time, is not an object or thing.  space is another form of our animal understanding.  and does not have an independent reality. we carry space and time around with us like turtles with shells.  there is no absolute self existing matrix in which physical events occur independent of life &#xD;
