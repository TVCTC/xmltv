    <desc lang="en">Our guests are Dr. Stephanie Getty from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Dr. Richard Quinn from the NASA Ames Research Center. This week we will be discussing the process of developing scientific instruments for the search for life beyond Earth. Drs. Getty and Quinn have been on numerous instrument and mission development teams ranging from the Mars Science Laboratory to future missions like Europa Clipper and DAVINCI. They are also on the organizing committee of an ongoing workshop from NASA called the Future of the Search for Life (FoSL), which has brought together researchers and technologists to talk about the synergies in technology development and life detection science. Aired March 30, 2022</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tech On Deck</title>
    <desc lang="en">You’ve probably heard a lot about the incredible science that happens on board the station, but the outside is actually prime real estate for all kinds of experiments and technology development, too. Just like other NASA organizations, private entities, educational institutions, and government partners have used the International Space Station to conduct science and learn in a space environment, NASA’s Exploration &amp; In-space Services division (NExIS) has been sending payloads and providing tools to the orbiting lab for years to test and develop servicing technologies that will be incorporated into future missions. As we look to exploring our solar system and beyond, and establishing a sustained human presence in space beyond low-Earth orbit, many of these technologies will play a key role. In celebration of 20 continuous years of human habitation and research in space in November 2020, the Division launched a new series, “Tech on Deck,” that showcases these projects, focusing on exterior research payloads including robotic and astronaut tools. The series consists of five-minute, scripted segments, featuring short clips with relevant guests. Each episode focuses on a different NExIS technology demonstration mission on the orbiting laboratory, with the first providing a high-level introduction. One episode was shared each week during March and April 2021.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">You’ve probably heard a lot about the incredible science that happens on board the station, but the outside is actually prime real estate for all kinds of experiments and technology development, too. Just like other NASA organizations, private entities, educational institutions, and government partners have used the International Space Station to conduct science and learn in a space environment, NASA’s Exploration &amp; In-space Services division (NExIS) has been sending payloads and providing tools to the orbiting lab for years to test and develop servicing technologies that will be incorporated into future missions. As we look to exploring our solar system and beyond, and establishing a sustained human presence in space beyond low-Earth orbit, many of these technologies will play a key role. In celebration of 20 continuous years of human habitation and research in space in November 2020, the Division launched a new series, “Tech on Deck,” that showcases these projects, focusing on exterior research payloads including robotic and astronaut tools. The series consists of five-minute, scripted segments, featuring short clips with relevant guests. Each episode focuses on a different NExIS technology demonstration mission on the orbiting laboratory, with the first providing a high-level introduction. One episode was shared each week during March and April 2021.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our guests are Dr. Stephanie Getty from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Dr. Richard Quinn from the NASA Ames Research Center. This week we will be discussing the process of developing scientific instruments for the search for life beyond Earth. Drs. Getty and Quinn have been on numerous instrument and mission development teams ranging from the Mars Science Laboratory to future missions like Europa Clipper and DAVINCI. They are also on the organizing committee of an ongoing workshop from NASA called the Future of the Search for Life (FoSL), which has brought together researchers and technologists to talk about the synergies in technology development and life detection science. Aired March 30, 2022</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our guests are Dr. Stephanie Getty from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Dr. Richard Quinn from the NASA Ames Research Center. This week we will be discussing the process of developing scientific instruments for the search for life beyond Earth. Drs. Getty and Quinn have been on numerous instrument and mission development teams ranging from the Mars Science Laboratory to future missions like Europa Clipper and DAVINCI. They are also on the organizing committee of an ongoing workshop from NASA called the Future of the Search for Life (FoSL), which has brought together researchers and technologists to talk about the synergies in technology development and life detection science. Aired March 30, 2022</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tech On Deck</title>
    <desc lang="en">You’ve probably heard a lot about the incredible science that happens on board the station, but the outside is actually prime real estate for all kinds of experiments and technology development, too. Just like other NASA organizations, private entities, educational institutions, and government partners have used the International Space Station to conduct science and learn in a space environment, NASA’s Exploration &amp; In-space Services division (NExIS) has been sending payloads and providing tools to the orbiting lab for years to test and develop servicing technologies that will be incorporated into future missions. As we look to exploring our solar system and beyond, and establishing a sustained human presence in space beyond low-Earth orbit, many of these technologies will play a key role. In celebration of 20 continuous years of human habitation and research in space in November 2020, the Division launched a new series, “Tech on Deck,” that showcases these projects, focusing on exterior research payloads including robotic and astronaut tools. The series consists of five-minute, scripted segments, featuring short clips with relevant guests. Each episode focuses on a different NExIS technology demonstration mission on the orbiting laboratory, with the first providing a high-level introduction. One episode was shared each week during March and April 2021.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our guests are Dr. Stephanie Getty from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Dr. Richard Quinn from the NASA Ames Research Center. This week we will be discussing the process of developing scientific instruments for the search for life beyond Earth. Drs. Getty and Quinn have been on numerous instrument and mission development teams ranging from the Mars Science Laboratory to future missions like Europa Clipper and DAVINCI. They are also on the organizing committee of an ongoing workshop from NASA called the Future of the Search for Life (FoSL), which has brought together researchers and technologists to talk about the synergies in technology development and life detection science. Aired March 30, 2022</desc>
