Five images that show that the telescope is ready for its mission to create the most extensive 3D map of the Universe yet and uncover some of its hidden secrets – especially regarding the nature of dark energy and dark matter.

    <desc lang="en">For more than 20 years, ESA astronauts have joined other crew members on board the International Space Station. More than 240 people have lived and worked on the orbital outpost, carrying our essential research to advance our scientific knowledge in space, but also on Earth. In this special programme recorded for the 20th anniversary of the station, join the very first European astronaut on board Umberto Guidoni, together with Tim Peake, Thomas Pesquet and many others, as they reflect on the station’s remarkable achievements. Watch them recall the best moments of their time on board, including filming strikes from thunderstorms on Earth from the ISS cupola or even dressing up for Halloween. Finally, they share their thoughts on what space exploration might look like in the next 20 years. Duration: 0:30</desc>

Europe has joined USA and other nations to prepare the way for new lunar landings. The Artemis programme aims to establish permanent stations on and around our Moon. Humans will very likely walk again on the Moon in the coming decade – including European astronauts. ESA’s contribution to the Artemis programme is the European Service Module – the module that will provide electricity, water, air for the Orion spacecraft – as well as keeping it at the right temperature and on course.

Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. Duration: 0:30</desc>
