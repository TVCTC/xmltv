    <desc lang="en">How do you develop a spacecraft in the midst of a global pandemic? In this film, director Maarten Roos takes you behind the scenes of a very special mission called Juice. This new spacecraft developed by ESA took to the skies on 14th April 2023. After an eight-year journey, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the gas giant Jupiter and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In the first episode of this atmospheric documentary, follow the JUICE team as they are confronted with unexpected challenges, such as the Covid pandemic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">En novembre dernier, la toute nouvelle classe d’astronautes 2022 a été présentée au grand public. Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

But the work has not stopped for the ExoMars teams. In this programme we travel back to Turin, Italy to talk to the teams involved. New tests are being conducted on the rover’s Earth twin, while the real rover remains carefully stored in its ultra-clean room – where ultra-precise procedures remain in place, as our cameraman Francesco finds out once more. The ExoMars Rosalind Franklin mission has now a target launch date of 2028 for the trip to Mars. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The next generation of Europe’s vehicles to space is taking to the skies! After years in development, a more powerful version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C, made its debut and completed its inaugural flight in July 2022. Meanwhile, Ariane 6 is currently undergoing combined tests at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou. Both new rockets will ensure Europe’s independent access to space and will enable the continent to maintain leadership in the fast-changing commercial launch service market. In this programme, re-live the launch of Vega-C and hear from the people involved in its development.  Get a sneak peek into what the future looks like with the Vega-Evolution rocket, while the first reusable spacecraft, Space Rider, is getting ready for its first flight in 2023. Finally, we take you on a tour of Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, where both Vega-C and the Ariane rockets are being launched. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?

    <title lang="en">Detecting marine plastic pollution from space</title>
    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano and NASA astronaut Drew Morgan take you on a unique tour of the International Space Station shot in one take with two cameras strapped together. Luca and Drew take it in turns to guide you through the modules and spacecraft docked to the orbital outpost. Starting from the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft that bought Drew to the Space Station, the duo show each module and spacecraft docked with the International Space Station at the time it was recorded around the New Year 2020. Passing colleagues include NASA astronaut Jessica Meir and Christina Koch exercising and Russian cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka. The tour ends with a view from the Station’s Cupola observatory. (Duration 01:00:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Every day, the CaSSIS camera takes dozens of spectacular images of the red planet, from an orbit of 400 km above the surface. The ‘Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System’ (CaSSIS) is a camera onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spacecraft which was launched in 2016. This high-resolution camera enables scientists to enhance their understanding of the red planet's surface. So, who left these dark curly tracks on Mars? Are there giant worms or devils? Follow this award-winning programme to investigate some of Mars’ fascinating mysteries. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A year has passed since the launch of the rover to the Red Planet was put on hold, and then cancelled, because of events on Earth. But the work has not stopped for the ExoMars teams. In this programme we travel back to Turin, Italy to talk to the teams involved. New tests are being conducted on the rover’s Earth twin, while the real rover remains carefully stored in its ultra-clean room – where ultra-precise procedures remain in place, as our cameraman Francesco finds out once more. The ExoMars Rosalind Franklin mission has now a target launch date of 2028 for the trip to Mars. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
