The normal path for any US footballer was College and then playing for one of the US teams. She overcame tough times and by the end of her time in PSG she had scored 46 goals in 58 appearances. She left Europe for Portland to achieve her dream of playing at the Olympics in Rio 2016. Winning the 2019 World Cup with the team was definitely a key moment but she sees her Bronze medal in Tokyo 2020 as the highlight of her international career so far.</desc>
