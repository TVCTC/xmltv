    <title lang="en">India’s growing breaking scene makes room for B-Girls | Breaking Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">India’s Breaking scene started in the early 2000’s and has since exploded in popularity. While mostly male dominated, women are increasingly accepted and celebrated in the Indian Breaking scene.
We meet B-Girl Jo, the two-time BC One India champion from Bangalore, as she travels alone to Mumbai. There, she meets her friend Flying Machine who organizes a community celebration event where B-Girls have a chance to battle it out. As a leader for Indian female hip-hop dancers, Jo reflects on her position in the society. With her own hip-hop and yoga studio and inspired by the challenges she’s already had to overcome, she examines her journey with both excitement and wisdom.</desc>

    <title lang="en">French breakers set the scene for Paris 2024 Olympic Games| Breaking Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">France is a cultural melting pot. It’s also one of the biggest countries for Breaking with more than a thousand battles every year and some of the greatest international competitions. It’s also in Paris 2024 that Breaking will make its Olympic debut.
Dany Dann came to France from French Guyana to pursue a life in dance. Now, he juggles early morning shifts as a nurse, daily training and being a father – always with an eye on the next battle. Now reigning national champion, he trains with French national team members B-Girl Carlota and B-Boy Marlone for the WDSF World Breaking Championship in Paris.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Young breakers take over the streets of Medellin | Breaking Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">Colombia used to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world but has found new life through a revival in urban arts, becoming a global creative mecca. 
B-Girl Luma and 4Eskuela hip hop school, where she learnt Breaking and is now a teacher, have been instrumental to this change in Medellin (Colombia). But it’s not been an easy journey for Luma who also had her doubts about what she can really achieve through dancing. By winning international dance events around the world, she is now confident it gave her a career and a drive, also when teaching young kids in her neighbourhood. She is keen to participate to Paris 2024.</desc>
