    <desc lang="en">At 42 years old, Deanna Stellato Dudek is attempting one of the most extraordinary comebacks in sport, returning to the ice sixteen years after retiring from figure skating to chase her unfinished Olympic dream. Deanna’s Dream follows her year-long journey toward qualifying for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, delving into her childhood as a prodigy, the injury that forced her to quit, the life she built beyond skating, and the fire that never went out. Through intimate access at home, in training, and on the international circuit, the film reveals the discipline, vulnerability, emotional resilience, and relentless belief required to compete at the highest level against athletes half her age. </desc>
