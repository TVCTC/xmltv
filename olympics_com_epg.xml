    <desc lang="en">MLK finally enters the playoffs. Three more games separate the team from their goal but their starting goalkeeper is now suspended.

Defender Vakaba, who has come to New York City to fulfil his dream, joins the team and becomes an essential part of its success.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">MLK high school has been unstoppable this year. They are about to achieve an undefeated season. But Coach Jake is getting increasingly tense.

Raymond is trying to live up to the dreams and expectations of his father, a talented goalkeeper himself who never made it pro. Soon the team faces a decisive game which will determine the number one seed in the playoffs.</desc>
