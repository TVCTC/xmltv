    <desc lang="en">Lydia Williams grew up in an Aboriginal community in the middle of Western Australia. At 11, she moved to Canberra. Her mum who was from the US signed her up for football. The local club that she joined only had one position left in division one: goalkeeper. She lost her father at 15 and put all her efforts into football. She was 16 when she made her debut for Australia and 19 at her first World Cup. Rio 2016 Olympics was a special moment for her since Cathy Freeman had always inspired her. Having competed in three world cups and two Olympic Games, she has now reached 100 caps, no doubt that this home competition will be very special for her.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lindsey Horan is one of the first US players to have joined a European club as she decided to skip college and become professional at 18 when joining PSG. The normal path for any US footballer was College and then playing for one of the US teams. She overcame tough times and by the end of her time in PSG she had scored 46 goals in 58 appearances. She left Europe for Portland to achieve her dream of playing at the Olympics in Rio 2016. Winning the 2019 World Cup with the team was definitely a key moment but she sees her Bronze medal in Tokyo 2020 as the highlight of her international career so far.</desc>
