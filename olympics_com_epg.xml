    <title lang="en">Launch Party | Snowboard Edition</title>
    <desc lang="en">Every fall, the world’s best snowboarders gather in Saas-Fee, Switzerland to train, reconnect, and kick off the snow season. In an Olympic year, that ritual becomes even more intense, with higher stakes and sharper focus. Launch Party takes us inside this unique moment, capturing elite riders as they train, push limits, and reconnect ahead of the most important season of their lives. Led by Mark McMorris as he prepares for what could be his final Olympic Games, the film offers rare access to the reality of Olympic preparation away from competition. This is snowboarding at its most honest: raw, intense, and driven by the pursuit of excellence.</desc>
