    <title lang="en">India’s growing breaking scene makes room for B-Girls | Breaking Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">India’s Breaking scene started in the early 2000’s and has since exploded in popularity. While mostly male dominated, women are increasingly accepted and celebrated in the Indian Breaking scene.
We meet B-Girl Jo, the two-time BC One India champion from Bangalore, as she travels alone to Mumbai. There, she meets her friend Flying Machine who organizes a community celebration event where B-Girls have a chance to battle it out. As a leader for Indian female hip-hop dancers, Jo reflects on her position in the society. With her own hip-hop and yoga studio and inspired by the challenges she’s already had to overcome, she examines her journey with both excitement and wisdom.</desc>

B-Girl Luma and 4Eskuela hip hop school, where she learnt Breaking and is now a teacher, have been instrumental to this change in Medellin (Colombia). But it’s not been an easy journey for Luma who also had her doubts about what she can really achieve through dancing. By winning international dance events around the world, she is now confident it gave her a career and a drive, also when teaching young kids in her neighbourhood.
