    <desc lang="en">Ferreira is a powerful striker who lives to score goals, as reflected by her incredible stats. She can shoot with both feet and few defenders are able to match her phenomenal speed. She is the youngest of a family of six siblings. Spotted by a sport teacher as she was playing on the beach, she would take a 4-hour bus to get to training and back until she was called on U20 national team. She signed for Benfica in 2017 ended up with 49 goals in only 30 games. After 56 appearances and 30 goals in 2 seasons at Madrid CFF, she joined Barcelona in 2022. Tokyo 2020 is the highlight of her international career so far but she is ready to give it all for the Seleção at FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023. </desc>
