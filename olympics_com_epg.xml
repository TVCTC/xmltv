    <desc lang="en">India’s Breaking scene started in the early 2000’s and has since exploded in popularity. While mostly male dominated, women are increasingly accepted and celebrated in the Indian Breaking scene.
We meet B-Girl Jo, the two-time BC One India champion from Bangalore, as she travels alone to Mumbai. There, she meets her friend Flying Machine who organizes a community celebration event where B-Girls have a chance to battle it out. As a leader for Indian female hip-hop dancers, Jo reflects on her position in the society. With her own hip-hop and yoga studio and inspired by the challenges she’s already had to overcome, she examines her journey with both excitement and wisdom.</desc>
