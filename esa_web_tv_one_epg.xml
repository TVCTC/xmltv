It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2023, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In the first episode of this atmospheric documentary, follow the JUICE team as they are confronted with unexpected challenges, such as the Covid pandemic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this programme, get acquainted with ESA’s mission control centre, responsible for flying multiple spacecraft, and the global network of ground stations that keeps track. From the Arctic to the Antarctic, these ground stations communicate with the spacecraft, send commands and receive their valuable data. Back at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, teams work around the clock to operate spacecraft and ensure they are functioning properly. This 30-minute programme ends with a short film – ‘The Burn’ – that offers a glimpse into the time-critical manoeuvres ESA’s operations teams are sometimes faced with. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our round-up of the latest news happening in space and in Europe: check up on the most powerful telescope ever built, the James Webb Space Telescope which – positioned some 1.5 million km away from Earth – has already delivered the deepest, sharpest images of the Universe ever seen. Explore how humans are preparing to return to the Moon, for the first time since 1972 with the Artemis mission. Get an update on who is coming back from, and who is going to the International Space Station. We ask how the new astronaut selection process is developing, as the lucky successful candidates will be announced later in November. And at the end of our programme, we look back on the successful inaugural flight of the new medium-size rocket, Vega-C. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming?

    <desc lang="en">In this programme, get acquainted with ESA’s mission control centre, responsible for flying multiple spacecraft, and the global network of ground stations that keeps track. From the Arctic to the Antarctic, these ground stations communicate with the spacecraft, send commands and receive their valuable data. Back at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, teams work around the clock to operate spacecraft and ensure they are functioning properly. This 30-minute programme ends with a short film – ‘The Burn’ – that offers a glimpse into the time-critical manoeuvres ESA’s operations teams are sometimes faced with. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <title lang="en">An astronaut at mission control</title>
    <desc lang="en">Andreas Mogensen is busy training these days: he is the next ESA astronaut to fly to the International Space Station in summer 2023. Despite his busy schedule, he agreed to come and meet the experts who are flying our satellites and spacecrafts at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Why does an astronaut need to know about the handrails of the International Space Station before every spacewalk? What happens if a spacecraft is on a collision course with a faraway planet? How can sun radiation impact astronauts and…our electricity grids? Andreas’ encounters at ESOC will tell you all about it. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

Dans ce programme, suivez les préparatifs de Thomas Pesquet pour sa mission Alpha et son envol vers la Station Spatiale Internationale (ISS), où il restera jusqu’à l’automne 2021. Thomas vous fait visiter la station en français et répond aux questions des journalistes. Vous aimez les astronautes et les datas ? Ne manquez pas, dans ce programme, quatre épisodes de la série animée ‘Dastronautes’ réalisée par le Centre National d’Études Spatial (CNES). Au menu également, le Centre français répond à la question : est-ce la fin de l’SS ? Les activités de l’ESA dans le domaine climatique et de la recherche de vie sur Mars sont éclairées par des reportages Euronews/ESA. Et on vous dit tout sur le problème des débris dans l’espace - car pour garantir l’accès à l’espace pour les générations futures, il est temps d’agir ! (Duration 01:00:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Some 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth, the James Webb telescope is undergoing a complex deployment that will soon enable it to start looking into the universe. Launched in December last year, Webb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever built and it will revolutionise our understanding of our the cosmos – from the formation of stars and planets, to the birth of the first galaxies. With its iconic astronomical mirrors, how is Webb a telescope? And how will it unlock the secrets of the early universe? Join ESA astronomers Mark McCaughrean and Giovanna Giardino to discover more.

    <title lang="en">Space for our climate</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
