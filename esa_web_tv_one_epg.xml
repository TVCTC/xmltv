    <desc lang="en">The next generation of Europe’s vehicles to space is taking to the skies! After years in development, a more powerful version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C, made its debut and completed its inaugural flight in July 2022. Meanwhile, Ariane 6 is currently undergoing combined tests at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou. Both new rockets will ensure Europe’s independent access to space and will enable the continent to maintain leadership in the fast-changing commercial launch service market. In this programme, re-live the launch of Vega-C and hear from the people involved in its development.  Get a sneak peek into what the future looks like with the Vega-Evolution rocket, while the first reusable spacecraft, Space Rider, is getting ready for its first flight in 2023.

Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <desc lang="en">The next generation of Europe’s vehicles to space is taking to the skies! After years in development, a more powerful version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C, made its debut and completed its inaugural flight in July 2022. Meanwhile, Ariane 6 is currently undergoing combined tests at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou. Both new rockets will ensure Europe’s independent access to space and will enable the continent to maintain leadership in the fast-changing commercial launch service market. In this programme, re-live the launch of Vega-C and hear from the people involved in its development.  Get a sneak peek into what the future looks like with the Vega-Evolution rocket, while the first reusable spacecraft, Space Rider, is getting ready for its first flight in 2023. Finally, we take you on a tour of Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, where both Vega-C and the Ariane rockets are being launched. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth.

    <title lang="en">Space for our climate</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

Despite his busy schedule, he agreed to come and meet the experts who are flying our satellites and spacecrafts at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Why does an astronaut need to know about the handrails of the International Space Station before every spacewalk? What happens if a spacecraft is on a collision course with a faraway planet? How can sun radiation impact astronauts and…our electricity grids? Andreas’ encounters at ESOC will tell you all about it. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
