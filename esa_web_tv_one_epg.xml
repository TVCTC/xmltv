    <desc lang="en">Some 1.5 million kilometres away from Earth, the James Webb telescope is undergoing a complex deployment that will soon enable it to start looking into the universe. Launched in December last year, Webb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever built and it will revolutionise our understanding of our the cosmos – from the formation of stars and planets, to the birth of the first galaxies. With its iconic astronomical mirrors, how is Webb a telescope? And how will it unlock the secrets of the early universe? Join ESA astronomers Mark McCaughrean and Giovanna Giardino to discover more.

    <desc lang="en">How do you develop a spacecraft in the midst of a global pandemic? In this film, director Maarten Roos takes you behind the scenes of a very special mission called JUICE. It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2023, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In the first episode of this atmospheric documentary, follow the JUICE team as they are confronted with unexpected challenges, such as the Covid pandemic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

Paolo describes three missions that suffered unexpected and potentially fatal flaws: Smart-1, Cluster and Exosat, and how on-the-ground knowledge, innovation and ingenuity prevented their untimely demise, allowing the science to go on. Recounting his personal experiences, he illustrates the importance of effective communication, as well as leadership, coaching and learning – and lesson learned while working under pressure. For the full set of Paolo’s master class, see our Videos on Demand. (Duration 01:00:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Leadership at Mission Control</title>
    <desc lang="en">Join Head of Mission Operations Paolo Ferri as he takes us through major events in his career at ESA, solving the unexpected problems that are part of any space endeavour.  Paolo describes three missions that suffered unexpected and potentially fatal flaws: Smart-1, Cluster and Exosat, and how on-the-ground knowledge, innovation and ingenuity prevented their untimely demise, allowing the science to go on. Recounting his personal experiences, he illustrates the importance of effective communication, as well as leadership, coaching and learning – and lesson learned while working under pressure. For the full set of Paolo’s master class, see our Videos on Demand. (Duration 01:00:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">About 70% of our planet is made of water. While fresh water sustains life on Earth, it is also essential for living in space. In this new documentary, ESA astronaut Andre Kuipers recounts his experience living in orbit and looking at the blue face of ‘Planet Aqua’. What observations can astronauts and divers share when it comes to water? How do satellites track marine litter? And how are spacecraft-grade recycling systems being used back down on Earth? Watch to get all the answers. (Duration 01:00:00)</desc>
