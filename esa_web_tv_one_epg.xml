    <desc lang="en">The next generation of Europe’s vehicles to space is taking to the skies! After years in development, a more powerful version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C, made its debut and completed its inaugural flight in July 2022. Meanwhile, Ariane 6 is currently undergoing combined tests at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou. Both new rockets will ensure Europe’s independent access to space and will enable the continent to maintain leadership in the fast-changing commercial launch service market. In this programme, re-live the launch of Vega-C and hear from the people involved in its development.  Get a sneak peek into what the future looks like with the Vega-Evolution rocket, while the first reusable spacecraft, Space Rider, is getting ready for its first flight in 2023. Finally, we take you on a tour of Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, where both Vega-C and the Ariane rockets are being launched. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

From the Arctic to the Antarctic, these ground stations communicate with the spacecraft, send commands and receive their valuable data. Back at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, teams work around the clock to operate spacecraft and ensure they are functioning properly. This 30-minute programme ends with a short film – ‘The Burn’ – that offers a glimpse into the time-critical manoeuvres ESA’s operations teams are sometimes faced with. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After spending almost 200 days on the International Space Station and setting a new European record for spacewalks, Thomas Pesquet returned to Earth in November 2021, bringing his Alpha Mission to an end. In this programme, we look back on his second mission in space and get an exclusive interview with Thomas, freshly landed on European soil. Highlights also include the conversations he held from space with French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as with the rock band Coldplay. What’s next for Thomas? We hear from David Parker, ESA Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, to discuss upcoming missions, including sending humans back to the Moon. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The making of JUICE - The Instruments</title>
    <desc lang="en">Juice, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, is almost ready for launch on 13th April. The spacecraft has a state-of-the-art science payload comprising remote sensing, geophysical and in-situ instruments. Using these instruments scientists will study the atmosphere of Jupiter and the surfaces and exospheres of the icy moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In this new episode of The Making of JUICE, scientists of each of the instrument teams tell about what they plan to do once Juice arrives in the jovian system in 2031. (Duration 00:45:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A year has passed since the launch of the rover to the Red Planet was put on hold, and then cancelled, because of events on Earth. But the work has not stopped for the ExoMars teams. In this programme we travel back to Turin, Italy to talk to the teams involved. New tests are being conducted on the rover’s Earth twin, while the real rover remains carefully stored in its ultra-clean room – where ultra-precise procedures remain in place, as our cameraman Francesco finds out once more. The ExoMars Rosalind Franklin mission has now a target launch date of 2028 for the trip to Mars. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the hunt for the riskiest asteroid</title>
    <desc lang="en">What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

From the Arctic to the Antarctic, these ground stations communicate with the spacecraft, send commands and receive their valuable data. Back at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, teams work around the clock to operate spacecraft and ensure they are functioning properly. This 30-minute programme ends with a short film – ‘The Burn’ – that offers a glimpse into the time-critical manoeuvres ESA’s operations teams are sometimes faced with. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
