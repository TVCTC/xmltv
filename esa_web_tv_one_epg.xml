    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. Hera will be Europe and humankind's first investigation of a planetary defence technique aimed at deflecting asteroids and avoid a collision with Earth. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One space telescope launched in July 2023. Five stunning images released a couple of months later. In this programme, relive the moment ESA revealed to the world the first images of the Euclid spacecraft. Never before has a telescope been able to create such  full-colour images of the cosmos across such a large patch of the sky. Five images that show that the telescope is ready for its mission to create the most extensive 3D map of the Universe yet and uncover some of its hidden secrets – especially regarding the nature of dark energy and dark matter.

More than 240 people have lived and worked on the orbital outpost, carrying our essential research to advance our scientific knowledge in space, but also on Earth. In this special programme recorded for the 20th anniversary of the station, join the very first European astronaut on board Umberto Guidoni, together with Tim Peake, Thomas Pesquet and many others, as they reflect on the station’s remarkable achievements. Watch them recall the best moments of their time on board, including filming strikes from thunderstorms on Earth from the ISS cupola or even dressing up for Halloween. Finally, they share their thoughts on what space exploration might look like in the next 20 years. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?

In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

The story begins in 2017, when the team was accepted to ESA's educational CubeSat programme, Fly Your Satellite! Over the course of six years, they have designed, built, and tested the satellite with the help of ESA experts and with access to ESA's state-of-the-art spacecraft testing facilities. Finally, on 2 December 2023 EIRSAT-1 launched to space and the rest is Irish history. Níl aon satailít mar do shatailít féin!

According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming?

    <desc lang="en">More than 50 years after Neil Armstrong set foot on the surface of the Moon, our natural satellite is once again a prime goal of space exploration. Europe has joined USA and other nations to prepare the way for new lunar landings. The Artemis programme aims to establish permanent stations on and around our Moon. Humans will very likely walk again on the Moon in the coming decade – including European astronauts. ESA’s contribution to the Artemis programme is the European Service Module – the module that will provide electricity, water, air for the Orion spacecraft – as well as keeping it at the right temperature and on course. Want to know more about Artemis I, II, III and more? Watch this programme. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Celebrating the International Space Station</title>
    <desc lang="en">For more than 20 years, ESA astronauts have joined other crew members on board the International Space Station. More than 240 people have lived and worked on the orbital outpost, carrying our essential research to advance our scientific knowledge in space, but also on Earth. In this special programme recorded for the 20th anniversary of the station, join the very first European astronaut on board Umberto Guidoni, together with Tim Peake, Thomas Pesquet and many others, as they reflect on the station’s remarkable achievements. Watch them recall the best moments of their time on board, including filming strikes from thunderstorms on Earth from the ISS cupola or even dressing up for Halloween. Finally, they share their thoughts on what space exploration might look like in the next 20 years. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Return to the Moon: the Artemis journey</title>
    <desc lang="en">More than 50 years after Neil Armstrong set foot on the surface of the Moon, our natural satellite is once again a prime goal of space exploration. Europe has joined USA and other nations to prepare the way for new lunar landings. The Artemis programme aims to establish permanent stations on and around our Moon. Humans will very likely walk again on the Moon in the coming decade – including European astronauts. ESA’s contribution to the Artemis programme is the European Service Module – the module that will provide electricity, water, air for the Orion spacecraft – as well as keeping it at the right temperature and on course. Want to know more about Artemis I, II, III and more? Watch this programme. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">En novembre dernier, la toute nouvelle classe d’astronautes 2022 a été présentée au grand public. Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <title lang="en">The worst that can happen</title>
    <desc lang="en">A team of university students from University College Dublin has taken Ireland to space, for the very first time. The story begins in 2017, when the team was accepted to ESA's educational CubeSat programme, Fly Your Satellite! Over the course of six years, they have designed, built, and tested the satellite with the help of ESA experts and with access to ESA's state-of-the-art spacecraft testing facilities. Finally, on 2 December 2023 EIRSAT-1 launched to space and the rest is Irish history. Níl aon satailít mar do shatailít féin!
