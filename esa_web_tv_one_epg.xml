    <desc lang="en">In this special programme, filmmaker Maarten Roos takes you behind the scenes of a very special mission called JUICE. It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved. Duration: 00:30:00</desc>

According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">Our round-up of the latest news happening in space and in Europe: check up on the most powerful telescope ever built, the James Webb Space Telescope which – positioned some 1.5 million km away from Earth – has already delivered the deepest, sharpest images of the Universe ever seen. Explore how humans are preparing to return to the Moon, for the first time since 1972 with the Artemis mission. Get an update on who is coming back from, and who is going to the International Space Station. We ask how the new astronaut selection process is developing, as the lucky successful candidates will be announced later in November. And at the end of our programme, we look back on the successful inaugural flight of the new medium-size rocket, Vega-C. Duration: 00:30:00</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Cold, dark and remote: Antarctica is as close to space as you can get on Earth. No wonder both scientists and astronauts like to venture on the white continent. In this programme, we take you to the Concordia research station in Antarctica to meet the people spending their winter months in total isolation. We follow ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst on an expedition to retrieve meteorites from the ice. And a leading climate scientist delves into how and why the ice is melting fast not just in Antarctica, but all around the world. Duration: 00:30:00</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hiring astronauts!</title>
    <desc lang="en">Who wants to join the next class of ESA astronauts? More than 23 000 people do: that’s a record number of applicants for the vacancy notice published last year. Out of all these applications, 1361 people have been invited to phase two of the selection. It’s a rare opportunity: ESA is recruiting four to six new astronauts for the first time since 2008. So, what’s the recruitment process? How long will it take to hire and train the next generation of astronauts? Watch this programme to learn more. ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet shares his best tips for the recruitment process and we catch up with Guillaume Weerts, ESA Head of Space Medicine, to get a fresh update on the selection.

In this programme, we take you to the Concordia research station in Antarctica to meet the people spending their winter months in total isolation. We follow ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst on an expedition to retrieve meteorites from the ice. And a leading climate scientist delves into how and why the ice is melting fast not just in Antarctica, but all around the world. Duration: 00:30:00</desc>

In this new documentary, ESA astronaut Andre Kuipers recounts his experience living in orbit and looking at the blue face of ‘Planet Aqua’. What observations can astronauts and divers share when it comes to water? How do satellites track marine litter? And how are spacecraft-grade recycling systems being used back down on Earth?

    <title lang="en">Space for our climate</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved. Duration: 00:30:00</desc>
