Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <title lang="en">Space for our climate</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">Juice, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket on 14th April 2023. The spacecraft has a state-of-the-art science payload comprising remote sensing, geophysical and in-situ instruments. Using these instruments scientists will study the atmosphere of Jupiter and the surfaces and exospheres of the icy moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In this episode of The Making of JUICE, scientists of each of the instrument teams tell about what they plan to do once Juice arrives in the jovian system in 2031. (Duration 00:45:00)</desc>

According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars.

This new spacecraft developed by ESA took to the skies on 14th April 2023. After an eight-year journey, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the gas giant Jupiter and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In the first episode of this atmospheric documentary, follow the JUICE team as they are confronted with unexpected challenges, such as the Covid pandemic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming?
