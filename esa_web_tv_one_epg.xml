According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">ROUGH CUT: Samantha in space</title>
    <desc lang="en">Spend some time with Samantha Cristoforetti as she carries out the daily activities of an astronaut on the International Space Station (ISS): floating in space and conducting experiments in zero gravity, even doing some gardening and performing a spacewalk! This summer, Samantha became the first European woman to put a spacesuit on and exit the airlock of the ISS. In this programme, relive the slow and meticulous tasks a spacewalker must carry out including, on this occasion, some works on the European Robotic Arm. Rough Cut is the programme that lets you immerse yourself into key moments, without any commentary nor music. Only natural sounds and often, just the silence of our Universe.

    <title lang="en">Stories from the lab</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Materials and Electrical Components Laboratory at ESA’s ESTEC establishment in the Netherlands supports ESA projects at all stages of development. In this 30-minute programme, discover how experts found solution for a variety of issues from a stuck mobile gantry to Gaia’s failed memory modules. See how ‘beta cloth’ fibre was tested for resilience for the Aeolus mission, and how engineers research how spacecraft material respond to the extreme environment of space over time. The lab is an impartial authority – decades of accumulated experience to back up project teams, equipped to carry out a wide variety of tests in-house, or turn to a network of external facilities when required.

    <title lang="en">The worst that can happen</title>
    <desc lang="en">A team of university students from University College Dublin has taken Ireland to space, for the very first time. The story begins in 2017, when the team was accepted to ESA's educational CubeSat programme, Fly Your Satellite! Over the course of six years, they have designed, built, and tested the satellite with the help of ESA experts and with access to ESA's state-of-the-art spacecraft testing facilities. Finally, on 2 December 2023 EIRSAT-1 launched to space and the rest is Irish history. Níl aon satailít mar do shatailít féin! [There’s no satellite like your own satellite!] (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the hunt for the riskiest asteroid</title>
    <desc lang="en">What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Put your boots on and join ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, glaciologists and climate experts on the ice! (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
