    <desc lang="en">It is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space: the James Webb Space Telescope! Following Hubble Space Telescope’s footsteps, James Webb is unveiling the secrets of the creation of the Universe and making breakthrough discoveries in multiple fields of astronomy. Have you ever wondered what the early Universe looked like? Would you like to discover new galaxies?  Let’s travel back in time, dive into our origins and look at the striking infrared images of the most distant universe we have ever seen …so far. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

Why does an astronaut need to know about the handrails of the International Space Station before every spacewalk? What happens if a spacecraft is on a collision course with a faraway planet? How can sun radiation impact astronauts and…our electricity grids? Andreas’ encounters at ESOC will give you all the answers. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>
