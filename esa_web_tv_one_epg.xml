    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
