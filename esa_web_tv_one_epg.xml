    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A team of university students from University College Dublin has taken Ireland to space, for the very first time. The story begins in 2017, when the team was accepted to ESA's educational CubeSat programme, Fly Your Satellite! Over the course of six years, they have designed, built, and tested the satellite with the help of ESA experts and with access to ESA's state-of-the-art spacecraft testing facilities. Finally, on 2 December 2023 EIRSAT-1 launched to space and the rest is Irish history. Níl aon satailít mar do shatailít féin!

Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. Hera will be Europe and humankind's first investigation of a planetary defence technique aimed at deflecting asteroids and avoid a collision with Earth. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth.

    <desc lang="en">What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">Suitable for kids and adults alike, the five episodes of this cartoon series tell the story of the Hera mission, due to launch in October 2024. Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. Hera will be Europe and humankind's first investigation of a planetary defence technique aimed at deflecting asteroids and avoid a collision with Earth. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Space for our climate</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">For more than 20 years, ESA astronauts have joined other crew members on board the International Space Station. More than 240 people have lived and worked on the orbital outpost, carrying our essential research to advance our scientific knowledge in space, but also on Earth. In this special programme recorded for the 20th anniversary of the station, join the very first European astronaut on board Umberto Guidoni, together with Tim Peake, Thomas Pesquet and many others, as they reflect on the station’s remarkable achievements. Watch them recall the best moments of their time on board, including filming strikes from thunderstorms on Earth from the ISS cupola or even dressing up for Halloween. Finally, they share their thoughts on what space exploration might look like in the next 20 years. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What happens when a 50-metre asteroid threatens to strike Earth? In the movies, a superhero would probably save humanity at the last minute – but in reality? Enter Rosa Jesse, our Space Safety Editor and the detective in charge of finding out how risky this new asteroid really is. Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>
