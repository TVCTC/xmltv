According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming?

    <desc lang="en">Plastic pollution has become a major challenge not only on Earth but also in our seas -with terrible impacts on marine life and ecosystems. Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?  Could satellites track plastic litter drifting in the sea? Several ESA-led projects are starting to investigate. In this programme, follow ESA and Deltares researchers as they evaluate whether satellite instruments can detect and monitor marine plastic. (Duration 00:30:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A year has passed since the launch of the rover to the Red Planet was put on hold, and then cancelled, because of events on Earth. But the work has not stopped for the ExoMars teams. In this programme we travel back to Turin, Italy to talk to the teams involved. New tests are being conducted on the rover’s Earth twin, while the real rover remains carefully stored in its ultra-clean room – where ultra-precise procedures remain in place, as our cameraman Francesco finds out once more. The ExoMars Rosalind Franklin mission has now a target launch date of 2028 for the trip to Mars. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

Tackling marine litter is a complex challenge involving changes to our economic models, product conception, consumer behaviour and waste disposal systems around the globe. So how can space help out?

    <desc lang="en">En novembre dernier, la toute nouvelle classe d’astronautes 2022 a été présentée au grand public. Pour la première fois depuis 2009, l’ESA a en effet recruté 17 nouveaux astronautes, dont cinq seront astronautes ‘de carrière’. Parmi eux, une française, Sophie Adenot et un belge, Raphael Liégeois. Dans ce programme tout en français, découvrez ces nouveaux astronautes et suivez-les lors de leurs premiers entrainements au Centre Européen des Astronautes à Cologne en Allemagne. Développé en partenariat avec le Centre National d’Études Spatiales, ce programme fait également le point sur la formation des astronautes, sur le retour tant attendu de l’Homme sur la lune – et sur les préparatifs pour une future mission sur Mars. Au menu enfin : Thomas Pesquet nous parle d’eau et d’assainissement ; nous évoquerons aussi la gastronomie dans l’espace et la mesure des étoiles à travers la mission Gaia.

    <title lang="en">Space for our climate</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.

    <desc lang="en">Juice, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket on 14th April 2023. The spacecraft has a state-of-the-art science payload comprising remote sensing, geophysical and in-situ instruments. Using these instruments scientists will study the atmosphere of Jupiter and the surfaces and exospheres of the icy moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In this episode of The Making of JUICE, scientists of each of the instrument teams tell about what they plan to do once Juice arrives in the jovian system in 2031. (Duration 00:45:00)</desc>

Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. Hera will be Europe and humankind's first investigation of a planetary defence technique aimed at deflecting asteroids and avoid a collision with Earth. (Duration 00:15:00)</desc>
