For most of the athletes that participated it was the very first time they competed on a frozen lake. In this episode, we follow the athletes Nil Llop from Spain and Diego Amaya from Colombia. Nil and Diego won the two silver medals in the 500 metres and in the Mass Start categories, against all odds. This Silver Medal was historical for both countries because it was the first medal ever won by each country in a Speed Skating Olympic Competition. On top and equally impressive is the fact that no Speed Skating rinks exist in either of their home nations and so Nil and Diego both have to live away from home, abroad, in order to follow their dream of becoming professional Speed Skaters.</desc>

For most of the athletes that participated it was the very first time they competed on a frozen lake. In this episode, we follow the athletes Nil Llop from Spain and Diego Amaya from Colombia. Nil and Diego won the two silver medals in the 500 metres and in the Mass Start categories, against all odds. This Silver Medal was historical for both countries because it was the first medal ever won by each country in a Speed Skating Olympic Competition. On top and equally impressive is the fact that no Speed Skating rinks exist in either of their home nations and so Nil and Diego both have to live away from home, abroad, in order to follow their dream of becoming professional Speed Skaters.</desc>
