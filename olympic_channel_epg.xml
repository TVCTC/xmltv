Hasegawa came through the ranks at Nippon TV Beleza, a team she joined in 2009 as a 12-year-old, gradually progressing to the first team. She amassed over 100 appearances for the senior side of Nippon TV Beleza between 2013 &amp; 2019. Her goal was to be established in Japan first. Milan came with an offer. This was the perfect starting going to Europe. She fulfilled one of her dreams playing at Tokyo 2020 Olympics. She now sees the World Cup as an opportunity to repeat Japan’s 2011 title.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Melchie Dumornay is one of the most promising talents in world football. She is taking the French league by storm scoring 22 goals in 38 appearances. Her two goals for Haiti have made history, qualifying the team for their first-ever Women’s World Cup. At 15, she was already playing in the Haitian 1st division and became the league’s top scorer. Reaching U20 national team, 50 clubs wanted Dumornay, clubs in Asia, Europe, US. But Durmonay would choose Reims in the French league. A club renowned for its ability to nurture and develop young talents while offering them the chance to compete in one of Europe’s top leagues. No one was expecting “les Grenadières” to qualify for the World Cup, so who knows what can happen. Melchie hopes that the team will continue to develop and one day be part of the Olympics.</desc>
