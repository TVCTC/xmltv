Teenagers Caitlin Nash and Natalie Corless from the Canadian Team arrive at the Olympia Bob Run to do the track walk with their coach Matt Murray. We follow their participation during the Olympic Games: training, sleds preparation and the day of competition. Following a tricky first round in the Competition Day, the Canadian couple makes some sled adjustment and in the second and final round they secure the silver medal in what was an emotional journey through friendship, camaraderie, and the thrills and spills of this awesome sliding discipline.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For the first time, a competition of Women's Doubles Luge is being hosted in an Olympic Games. Teenagers Caitlin Nash and Natalie Corless from the Canadian Team arrive at the Olympia Bob Run to do the track walk with their coach Matt Murray. We follow their participation during the Olympic Games: training, sleds preparation and the day of competition. Following a tricky first round in the Competition Day, the Canadian couple makes some sled adjustment and in the second and final round they secure the silver medal in what was an emotional journey through friendship, camaraderie, and the thrills and spills of this awesome sliding discipline.</desc>
