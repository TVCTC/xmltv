    <desc lang="en">Lydia Williams grew up in an Aboriginal community in the middle of Western Australia. At 11, she moved to Canberra. Her mum who was from the US signed her up for football. The local club that she joined only had one position left in division one: goalkeeper. She lost her father at 15 and put all her efforts into football. She was 16 when she made her debut for Australia and 19 at her first World Cup. Rio 2016 Olympics was a special moment for her since Cathy Freeman had always inspired her. Having competed in three world cups and two Olympic Games, she has now reached 100 caps, no doubt that this home competition will be very special for her.</desc>
