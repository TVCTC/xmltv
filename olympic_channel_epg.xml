From a farming village in the middle of Colombia to being the best number 10 of her country, Leicy Santos’ story is an amazing journey. She left alone to Bogota at 12 and at 15 years old, she was called into the national team. She participated in Rio 2016 Olympics. After winning the first ever professional women’s championship in 2017 with Santa Fe, in 2019, she was the first ever Colombian Player to be signed for a European team, first Colombian player to score in the Champions League and MVP in 2019/20 for Atletico Madrid. She now targets top 3 at FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Brighton keeper from Australia in fourth World Cup | World at their Feet</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lydia Williams grew up in an Aboriginal community in the middle of Western Australia. At 11, she moved to Canberra. Her mum who was from the US signed her up for football. The local club that she joined only had one position left in division one: goalkeeper. She lost her father at 15 and put all her efforts into football. She was 16 when she made her debut for Australia and 19 at her first World Cup. Rio 2016 Olympics was a special moment for her since Cathy Freeman had always inspired her. Having competed in three world cups and two Olympic Games, she has now reached 100 caps, no doubt that this home competition will be very special for her.</desc>
