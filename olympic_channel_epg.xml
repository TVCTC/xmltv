    <desc lang="en">For the first time, a competition of Women's Doubles Luge is being hosted in an Olympic Games. Teenagers Caitlin Nash and Natalie Corless from the Canadian Team arrive at the Olympia Bob Run to do the track walk with their coach Matt Murray. We follow their participation during the Olympic Games: training, sleds preparation and the day of competition. Following a tricky first round in the Competition Day, the Canadian couple makes some sled adjustment and in the second and final round they secure the silver medal in what was an emotional journey through friendship, camaraderie, and the thrills and spills of this awesome sliding discipline.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The St. Moritz frozen lake was the unusual venue that hosted the Speed Skating competition. For most of the athletes that participated it was the very first time they competed on a frozen lake. In this episode, we follow the athletes Nil Llop from Spain and Diego Amaya from Colombia. Nil and Diego won the two silver medals in the 500 metres and in the Mass Start categories, against all odds. This Silver Medal was historical for both countries because it was the first medal ever won by each country in a Speed Skating Olympic Competition. On top and equally impressive is the fact that no Speed Skating rinks exist in either of their home nations and so Nil and Diego both have to live away from home, abroad, in order to follow their dream of becoming professional Speed Skaters.</desc>
