    <title lang="hr">Looking for Sultan</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(England, 2017) Despite efforts to protect tigers for the past 4 decades, tigers continue to be hunted down - poached, poisoned and squeezed into small pockets of protected forests.Tigers play a pivotal role in maintaining the health of the forest ecosystem and there is an urgent need to protect the tiger and its habitat.In India and across the world, Tigers have captured our imagination for centuries. We have feared them, respected them and even worshipped them. But during the colonial times tigers were hunted in thousands.At the turn of the century over a 100,000 tigers existed on the planet. Almost 40,000 of these were in India. But today only 3800 tigers survive across the world and 70% of these are in India.Today each and every tiger is important and that's why we need to find Sultan.This film follows the story of Sultan, the up and coming dominant tiger of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve who vanished suddenly.Father and son wildlife filmmakers, Mike and Gautam, had been following and filming him since he was a cub and are now trying to put the pieces together to solve this mystery.More than 12 tigers have gone missing in Ranthambhore between 2012 and 2017. Young tigers who go missing are usually thought to have been poached or just lost forever. But the story is much more complicated.Tigers are born in parks and forests - a safe, secure place protected by their mother. But once these tigers mature they must find new homes but the question is where will they go? Trackers on ground have proved that tigers leave the protected territory of national parks to walk great distances in search for new territory. Tigers know no borders and young sub adult tigers must walk hundreds of kilometres to find a new home, prey and a new mate. Once they walk out of the protected area of the forest they are in direct contact with human habitation. People and tigers now share a complicated relationship - one of constant fear of the other.This is the story all across the country. Isolated populations of tigers in small fragmented forests surrounded by human beings and villages. The film looks at broader issues of conservation of tigers and their relationship with the people who share their habitat and the different efforts being made towards conservation in India through the story of Sultan.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">The Mystery Of the Disappearing Bees</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(France, Canada, 2010) An investigation into a worldwide ecological disaster that could endanger the whole of humanity. The future of our food resources depends on one small insect - the western honey bee, or Apis mellifera. Indeed, it is the most important agricultural pollinator on our planet given that one third of our food supply depends directly on pollination from bees. This documentary tells the story of a worldwide ecological disaster that has been waiting to happen for several generations. It was filmed over an 18-month period in France, Germany, the U.S., Canada and Scotland and retraces the various leads carried out by research scientists in order to try and understand and to stop the declining numbers of domestic and wild bees. Scientists are not the only professionals to figure at the centre of this drama. Beekeepers are in the front line, and striking contrasts exist among beekeepers' experiences in different countries, in various economic situations. The documentary seeks to understand how the long-enjoyed harmonious relationship between man and bee has now undergone such a radical change. It seeks to find a solution that goes beyond science. A solution that cannot be found without thoroughly re-examining our agricultural practice and our model of society. Can we rise to the challenge?

    <desc lang="hr">(France, Germany, 2009) For centuries, in Japan, mollusc fishing has been a women business. 360° Geo - Report takes a plunge into the closed world of a group of "Ama".For centuries, diving for seafood in Japan has been "ladies work" and is done by "Ama", or "women of the sea". They carry on collecting the precious seafood from the sea bottom until well into old age, braving the depths by the sheer virtue of their breath. Their skin is tanned by the elements, their voice roughened, deep and loud.For centuries, 9 women from the Japanese peninsula of Shima have shared their fate on a boat and grown together to become a close-knit sea-faring family. Kazu Yamamoto, at nearly 80 years of age, is the oldest in the group, a 5th-generation 'Ama'. She has by no means thought about giving up her work yet: "In the sea I can feel and move my body better than a shore. Once in the water all pain disappears, also suddenly my back doesn't hurt anymore", Kazu Yamamoto explains.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Dolphins: Beauty Before Brains</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(South Africa, 2011) Humans have built various legends surrounding the dolphin. These likeable creatures have inspired and enthralled us through the ages and have seemingly secured their place beside us as one of the most intelligent mammals on the planet. But how do we measure this intelligence? And how smart are dolphins really? If intelligence is defined by the ability to reason, plan, solve problems and learn from experience, how does the dolphin weigh up? "Dolphins - Beauty Before Brains?" (1 x 52' HD), takes us on a scientific journey into the complex world of the dolphin and investigates the controversy surrounding Professor Paul Manger's recent assertion that dolphins are not quite as smart as we'd previously thought – "dumber than a goldfish" were the words he used. According to his studies, dolphins appear to have brains that lack complexity at neuronal level, which compromises their information-processing abilities. By examining a series of experiments testing the "theory of mind" in dolphins and exploring unique and engaging habits like self-awareness, creative responses and self-entertainment such as wave-riding, this film illustrates exactly where dolphin IQ scores on the charts. We also look at unique behaviour patterns, pod dynamics, communication skills and hunting strategies that play out in mass feeding events such as the Sardine Run on the South African coastline. The dolphins' Sardine Run behaviour is one of the most amazing spectacles of intelligence and co-operation in the natural world. We then travel to Mozambique to meet Angie Gullan, the "Dolphin Whisperer". She has monitored and interacted with four local pods for the past ten years and facilitates dolphin "swims" that are said to have physiological healing effects on human beings. According to her observations, dolphins rank at the top when it comes to emotional intelligence. So is Professor Manger correct in his assessment of dolphins and how does his study compare with the facts? Could dolphin intelligence, or lack thereof, be something that varies from one individual to the next?</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Singapore) In contrast with popular belief, Edison did not invent the light bulb. Many people contributed to the invention. Mind you, the first lamp was invented around 70,000 BC. Once upon a time we had limelight, which was actually quite unsafe, and then there were arc "arc lamps" – shedding light that blinded movie stars up to the point where they had to wear sunglasses. What Edison did was improve the light bulb to become a practical, affordable and safe product. He tested over 5000 filaments to make the bulb last: from bamboo fiber to a hair out of an assistant's beard. At the same time others were working on light bulbs made with gasses, which we now know as energy efficient lamps. Modern-day lighting innovations are quite startling, a lot of them - we can't even see with the naked eye… Lasers, for example. For the longest time it was merely a pet-theory of the grand Einstein. Nobody knew what to make of this idea that "atoms could release their excess energy as light" When the laser was invented, people joked that the laser was 'a solution looking for a problem'. Now it is omnipresent. In the near future: laser-light therapy by flashing the human brain.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Quirky Science</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Singapore) A man with an ear for music, one of the first to try teaching the deaf how to speak, thought he could build a "harmonic telegraph". He had this idea that several notes could travel through a wire simultaneously, instead of the one Morse code that the telegraph could transmit. He thought this to be possible because he misinterpreted the writings of a researcher writing in German – a language he did not know. – And would later describe his misinterpretation as a "very valuable blunder". The man was Alexander Graham Bell and he invented telephony. The big question is: what happens in that wire? How can voices travel? Bell and his assistant eventually proved that different tones would vary the strength of an electric current in a wire. In fact, it's the vibrations of the voice that determine the strength of the current. His invention caused a lot of fuss – yet it took years before people comprehended the scale of it: before the widespread use of the phone – whom were you going to call? Eventually, the telephone, or better said, its wiring, leads to the Internet. Nowadays we mostly make our calls "wireless" so the wire Graham Bell used to make voices travel over long distances is no longer needed How does that work? Even wireless calling, some say, is actually a very unnatural way of communicating. Looking at the future, are we heading towards a "phoneless" call?</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(England, 2008) The discovery in Jerusalem in 2007 of a tomb said to belong to the family of Jesus of Nazareth is just the latest in a long line of extraordinary finds which have recently come to light in the Holy Land. But not all these finds are quite what they seem. Both a stone tablet said to come from the Temple of Solomon, and an ossuary apparently belonging to the brother of Jesus, have been declared fakes. The official investigation then uncovered dozens of other fakes, and attention eventually focussed on one of the most revered objects in Israel: the ivory pomegranate. This artefact has been in the Israel Museum for nearly twenty years. Like the stone tablet, it too was linked to the Temple of Solomon – and astonishingly it too, investigators concluded, was fake. As forensic scientists now turn their attention to the ossuaries from the 'Jesus family tomb', Israeli archaeologists are left fearing that history and science is being repeatedly distorted, and they face a challenge to separate fact from fiction.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(France, 2009) The international scientific community is called on to take sides and provide solid answers. "Surrounded by Waves" explores the methods and motivations behind the most prominent research in the field and clarifies what we currently know, all with a mind to the social context behind the issue. Through an elegant blend of interviews, archives, experiments and 3D animation, the film clearly assesses the estimated risk linked to cell phones while offering a subtle observation of society's growing distrust of its industries and the unprecedented role of science in the debate.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">River King</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Netherlands, 2016) Some parts of Africa have not been explored by even the most adventurous anglers. Wars, upheavals and uncertainties have made large areas of the Nile Basin in particular too challenging and dangerous to visit. 

Wim Seffelaar is a teacher in daily life, but a keen angler whenever he has the chance. Over the decades he has explored some of the remotest rivers of Africa. Now he is on a quest to catch one of the most iconic and elusive of all African river fish – the legendary Nile perch. They grow to enormous proportions on a stretch of river bordering South Sudan – an area normally off limits to tourists, but with the help of local friends, Wim manages to secure the permits to allow him into this troubled area. 

As he follows the river searching for likely locations, he immerses himself in the tribal life along the waterways. Everyone seems to be fishing here, albeit each with their own methods. Not only the many kingfishers, pelicans and crocodiles, but also the people, young and old. What may be sport to the angler is the livelihood of many here. If you don't catch something, you and your family go hungry.

Child hunters convince him to follow them to their inland lake and show off their skill at catching a variety of fish, but the most remarkable local fishing tactics take place on dry soil. During the dry season, fish survive by burrowing themselves in the mud and staying dormant until the rains form new rivers. The locations of these buried fish or "mudfish" can be given away by subtle movements of the ground. A man whose feet can detect that faint movement above ground can spear the fish through the soil, dig it out and slowly hook it free from the earth.

As he continues his way upstream, enormous bush fires stand in his way, the temperature rises to unbearable heights and the water level drops. The turning point in his expedition comes when he gets help from a former rebel who has fought in the area and knows the river like the back of his hand. With the help of his new friend he moves further afield, onwards to deeper water, indicated by the presence of large crocodiles. 

Here lies the promise of the giant. After landing a few huge tigerfish, Wim eventually hooks into a goliath that turns out to be no less than 113 kg, one of the largest Nile perches ever caught on a rod and fishing line.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Priča o Gulagu</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2019) Kao velika politička, povijesna, ljudska i gospodarska činjenica kompletnog 20. stoljeća, Gulag, ekstremno oštar sovjetski koncentracijski logor uglavnom ostaje nepoznat. Povijest Gulaga je dugačka, kompleksna i na mnoge načine neuobičajena. Još od velike revolucije 1917. pa sve do vremena Gorbačova, baveći se razdobljima građanskog rata, velikog terora, Drugog Svjetskog rata, Hladnog rata i smrti Staljina, ovaj dokumentarni serijal opisuje kako je funkcionirao Gulag. Kako i zašto je Sovjetski Savez kreirao sistem kampova za prisilni rad u kojem je više od dvadeset milijuna zatvorenika bilo izrabljivano do smrt? Kroz nevjerojatne sudbine nebrojenih protagonista, s jedne i s druge strane (krvnika i zatvorenika) uz nikad prije objavljene dokumentarne izvore i pomoć povjesničara i stručnjaka, ovaj dokumentarni serijal pokušava nam dešifrirati što je zapravo bio Gulag.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Posljednji preživjeli: Tko je ubio Biggieja i Tupaca</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Engleska, 2021) Suge Knight, bivši direktor legendarne izdavačke glazbene kuće Death Row Records, nedavno je osuđen na 28 godina zatvora zbog ubojstva i drugih nasilnih zločina koji obično nisu povezani s vrlo uspješnim direktorom. Ovaj film prikazuje Death Row te opisuje kako je kultura uličnih bandi L.A.-a dominirala njihovim poslovima. Kada je Tupac Shakur bio u zatvoru zbog seksualnog zlostavljanja, bio je izvođač pod ugovorom s kompanijom Interscope. Ali Suge Knight i Death Row Records, podružnica Interscopea, priskočili su mu u pomoć i ponudili Tupacu ugovor u zamjenu za njegovu slobodu. To je rezultiralo Tupacovom odanošću uličnoj bandi Piru te je sa Suge Knightom u potpunost prihvatio taj svijet. Povezanost s bandom Piru na kraju je bila uzrok njegove smrti jer je samo 11 mjeseci kasnije Tupac ubijen. Film se također osvrće na navode bivšeg detektiva LAPD-a Russela Poolea da je ubojstvo Biggie Smallsa, odmazdu za ubojstvo Tupaca, naručio Suge Knight uz pomoć korumpiranih policajaca LAPD-a koji su radili na crno za Death Row Records.</desc>

Elitni financijaši pronevjerili su 3,5 milijardi dolara iz državnog fonda Malezije po imenu 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad). Novac iz ove bezočne prevare prebačen je u New York i Hollywood kojim su lopovi privlačili najveće zvijezde, pa su tako financirali Leonardu di Capriu film "Vuk s Wall Streeta". No, istraživački novinari New York Timesa, Wall Street Journala i Hollywood Reportera pratili su trag novca i razotkrili prevaru. Američko Ministarstvo pravosuđa se uključilo, ministar i njegovi suradnici su osumnjičeni, imovina je zamrznuta, novac zaplijenjen a narod Malezije odlučio je uzvratiti udarac.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Žene u rock'n'rollu</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(SAD, 2022) "Žene u rock'n'rollu" zadivljujuća je četverodijelna dokumentarna serija koja govori o ženama u glazbi koje žestoko rokaju potrazi za umjetnošću, izražavanjem i uvijek nedostižnim uspjehom. Istražujući borbu za preživljavanje i napredak u poslu kojim su nekoć dominirali muškarci, serija je ukorijenjena u povijesnom i društvenom kontekstu rock ere, ali promatrana iz osobnih perspektiva najvećih rock umjetnica koje dijele svoje intimne priče, svoje inspiracije, težnje i motivacije. U svakoj epizodi pratimo zvijezde uključujući Chaku Khan, Pat Benatar, Mavis Staples, Shaniu Twain, Sheryl Crow i Nancy Wilson, uz doprinose zvijezda Tori Amos, Tegan &amp; Sara, Kate Pierson i mnogih drugih. Izvršni producent serije je slavni modni dizajner i glazbeni poduzetnik John Varvatos, a režirala ju je jedna od vodilja rocka, glazbena kritičarka i autorica Jessica Hopper.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2021) U Parizu, 15. travnja 1900. godine, počinje najveća proslava ikada održana na svijetu. Svjetski sajam potpuno transformira grad: egzotični luksuzni hoteli koji krase obale Seine, kolosalni spomenici koji se pojavljuju na svakom uglu ulice i šetnice samo su neke od značajki koje očaravaju publiku. Više od 50 milijuna posjetitelja otkriva ovaj novi Pariz, uzvišen dolaskom struje. Kako su inženjeri uspjeli postaviti električni, podzemni sustav podzemne željeznice u manje od dvije godine? Zašto su sagradili Grand Palais na stubovima? Koje su tehnološke izazove svladali kako bi osmislili Gare d'Orsay u srcu Pariza? Gigantske zgrade podignute su u rekordnom roku. Stotinu i dvadeset godina kasnije neki su i danas među najljepšim spomenicima glavnog grada.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(SAD, 2014) "Dva i pol muškarca" prikazuje život dvojice braće, sina/nećaka i mnoštva žena koje ih okružuju. Točnije, Charlie Harper dobrostojeći je neženja s kućom na obali, Mercedesom u garaži i znanjem vještog ophođenja sa ženama. Ali njegov opušteni život u Malibuu ometaju njegov ukočeni i napeti brat Alan i Alanov sin Jake, koji već godinama žive kod njega. Unatoč kompleksnosti njihovih života i njihovim međusobnim napetim odnosima, Charlie i Alan jedno imaju zajedničko: obojica vole Jakea i žele mu samo najbolje. Zato uspijevaju stvoriti malu obiteljsku zajednicu u kojoj bi svatko od njih mogao postati bolji čovjek.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Etno sat</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Etno sat</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(Rat grafitima, Bosna i Hercegovina) Još u 19. vijeku, pojedini grafit-majstori smatraju se i najvećim zvijezdama moderne umjetnosti a njihova djela postaju turističke atrakcije izvan zidova galerija i muzeja. U Srbiji se primjećuje sličan trend - Pijanista, TKV, Resto, Junk i drugi ulični umjetnici, postaju priznati i izvan granica svojih gradova - u Beogradu se već organizuju turističke rute i obilasci najznačajnijih radova, grafita, murala, street arta. Osim što su grafiti potreba umjetnika da se izrazi, oni su i najjeftiniji oblik političkog marketinga. Najstariji politički grafit u Beogradu star je više od 100 godina i nalazi se u Sremskoj ulici. Politički gerila marketing ima dugu tradiciju u Beogradu, a ovaj je 1920. pozivao da se glasa za Filipa Filipovića, člana Socijalističke radničke partije, koji je tog ljeta izabran za predsjednika beogradske općine. Politički grafiti bili su aktuelni tokom okupacije, gdje se komunistički, partizanski pokret na taj način, koristeći boju i zid kao medij, obraćao široj javnosti, u nedostatku drugih medija. Tokom devedesetih, zidovi su bili mjesta za pokazivanje otpora nacionalističkim trendovima koji su vladali establišmentom. Krajem dekade, pojavom organizacije "Otpor", poruke na zidu i nacrtana pesnica postaju simbol borbe protiv tadašnjeg režima i zvanične politike.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(San o slobodi, Bosna i Hercegovina) Godine 2017. sestre i režiserke Georgia i Sophia Scott dobile su neposredan pristup priči o zatvorenom palestinskom političkom vođi Marwanu Barghoutiju. Blisko sarađujući s Marwanovom porodicom na okupiranoj Zapadnoj obali u Palestini sestre Scott provele su više od tri godine, prateći njihovu borbu s njegovim zatvoreničkim štrajkom glađu. Pažljivo osmišljen, odvažan i humanistički u pristupu, film prikazuje snažnu sliku čovjeka koji bi jednog dana mogao voditi palestinski narod i postavlja pitanje: Može li mir između Izraela i Palestine biti postignut s pravim vođama?</desc>

S majkom i četiri sestre pobjegla je iz Kabula kako bi se spasila od nasilja. Kao i milione njihovih sunarodnjaka, iscrpio ih je višedecenijski sukob u kojem su zemlju okupirale ruske, a potom i američke snage. Danas su talibani ponovno preuzeli vlast. Fudbalska strast je ono što je spasilo Nadiju. Postala je napadačica u reprezentaciji svoje nove domovine Danske, a zatim se pridružila ženskoj ekipi kluba Paris Saint-Germain. Sada, kada je postala fudbalska zvijezda, Nadia se želi vratiti u Afganistan kako bi saznala više o očevoj sudbini. No, zemlju razdire terorizam, dok talibani i ISIL svakodnevno stvaraju haos. Odustavši od putovanja, Nadia doživljava još jedan težak gubitak. Međutim, nepokolebljiva je i odlučna. U budućnosti planira diplomirati rekonstruktivnu hirurgiju i spašavati ljude.</desc>

V pogovoru s prevajalko knjige Bambi: Življenjska pot v gozdu odkrivamo pravo, ne Hollywoodsko bistvo zgodbe, ki jo je v začetku 20. stoletja zapisal pisatelj Felix Saltn.

    <desc lang="si">(Vogel in Sevnica, Slovenija) V tokratni oddaji Na lepše izpostavljamo nočni ogled Sevniškega gradu, kjer se ob soju več kot sto prižganih sveč, odkriva zgodbe nekdanjih žensk, ki so s svojim delovanjem zaznamovale grad tekom stoletij. Obiskali smo prenovljeni Vodovodni stolp v Brežicah, ki za nekaj metrov presega povprečno višino vodovodnih stolpov v svetu, ki znaša 40 metrov. Brežiški stolp kot spomenik tehniške in kulturne dediščine, je celo naveden na seznamu 43 slavnih vodovodnih stolpov na svetu, ki še stojijo v Sloveniji, Kanadi, na Hrvaškem, v Angliji, Združenih državah Amerike, Indoneziji in na Slovaškem. V oddaji tudi zgodba o Mozirskem gaju, ki po avgustovski vodni ujmi, v kateri so utrpeli precej škode, z decembrom znova odprli vrata. Za obiskovalce so pripravili praznično Božično bajko z 1,8 milijona lučkami, ki bodo sijale do 7. januarja. Mozirski gaj so po poplavah s pomočjo gradbene mehanizacije in številnih prostovoljcev očistili mulja in vode, uspeli so popraviti uničeno infrastrukturo, urediti poškodovane sprehajalne steze in na novo zasaditi nekaj cvetličnih gredic. Tudi na letošnji Božični bajki Slovenije se bodo obiskovalci lahko sprehodili med tematskimi vrtovi in v vsakem kotičku parka začutili praznično vzdušje ter skupaj z vodstvom gaja delili tudi hvaležnost, da so jih lahko po avgustovskih katastrofalnih poplavah tako kmalu ponovno povabili v njihov park. Priprave na zimsko sezono so v polnem teku, izbrana slovenska smučišča pa bodo letos prvič zagnala tudi posodobljene naprave. Ekipa Na lepše je obiskala Vogel, kjer so z zadnjo investicijo v kar devet slovenskih smučarskih centrov, financirali gradnjo panoramske krožne kabinske žičnice Zadnji Vogel. S kabinsko žičnico se bo tako letošnjo zimo lahko vozilo do deset ljudi, kar je bistveno več, kot jih lahko prevozi trenutna stara dvosedežnica.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija) V Orleku na Krasu, kjer rada zapiha burja, se narava in arhitektura prepletata v harmonično celoto. Tam stoji edinstven dom, ki je plod ustvarjalnosti arhitekturnega para. Njuna hiša s kraškimi elementi in plezalno steno v notranjosti je energetsko učinkovita in trdna kot kamen, čeprav je zgrajena iz povsem drugega materiala. V pomladni sezoni smo prikazali zares majhno stanovanje v tristo let stari hiši v središču Ljubljane. Že takrat smo omenili, da so nekdanje veliko stanovanje predelali v tri manjše bivalne enote. Odprli so nam vrata v še eno od teh stanovanj, katerega površina znaša le 30 kvadratnih metrov. Ko otroci odletijo iz gnezda, je čas za spremembe v načinu bivanja. Nekateri se odločijo za prodajo nepremičnine in spremembo okolja, drugi pa za temeljito prenovo. Kako je nekdaj petsobno natrpano družinsko stanovanje po temeljiti preureditvi zadihalo v povsem novem udobju, vam pokažemo v tokratni oddaji.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Nemčija, Avstrija, 2021) Zgodba iz povojne Nemčije, ko so oblasti kljub padcu nacističnega režima množično zapirale istospolno usmerjene. Hansa po drugi svetovni vojni vedno znova pošiljajo v zapor samo zato, ker je homoseksualec. Komajda pozna življenje v zunanjem svetu in ta ustanova je edini prostor, kjer lahko razvije trajna razmerja. In tam Hans končno najde ljubezen, ob moškem, ki ne bi mogel biti bolj drugačen od njega - ob Viktorju, obsojenem morilcu. Odlok, s katerim so oblasti v Nemčiji zapirale homoseksualce, je bil v veljavi 123 let. V povojnem obdobju je samo v Zahodni Nemčiji stopilo pred sodnika več kot sto tisoč moških.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Ivan Regen, Slovenija) Ivan Regen je bil znanstvenik, ki je preučeval zvočno komunikacijo žuželk, biolog in pionir sodobne bioakustike. Danes širšemu občinstvu malo znani Ivan Regen (1868-1947), je bil človek, ki je preučeval murnove samičke, ki je znal govoriti z žuželkami in načrtovati fonografske naprave. Rojen je bil v Lajšah pri Gorenji vasi leta 1868, študiral in doktoriral je na Dunaju, kjer je tudi večinoma živel in preučeval zvočno komunikacijo žuželk. Leta 1935 je bil izvoljen za častnega člana Prirodoslovnega društva Slovenije, leta 1940 pa za dopisnega člana Slovenske akademije znanosti in umetnosti. Njegov največji projekt je bil geobiološki laboratorij, velik terarij oziroma insektarij,v katerem je preučeval fonotaksijo - usmerjeno premikanje žuželk proti viru zvoka. Dokazal je,da žuželke slišijo s posebnim organom na prvem paru nog. Dokumentarni portret Ivana Regna odstira delo velikega, slabo znanega slovenskega znanstvenika, hkrati pa osvetljuje pomen zvoka okoli nas tudi za tiste namene, na katere v našem vsakdanu niti ne pomislimo. Mnogokrat smo potopljeni v zvok, ki ga ne poslušamo, ker se ga ne zavedamo in ga zato tudi ne slišimo. Ti zvoki pa so lahko konstitutivni element glasbene umetnosti. Delo, ki ga je Ivan Regen začel ob koncu 19. tega stoletja, je našlo svoje mesto tudi v umetnosti - v bioakustični glasbi. Prav zato se film poetično konča z besedami: "Če ne bi bilo Ivana Regna, človeka, ki je govoril z žuželkami, in znanstvenikov moderne dobe, tudi bioakustične glasbe verjetno ne bi bilo. Hvala znanosti, da je nahranila umetnost!"</desc>
