    <title lang="hr">The Leopard's New Spots</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(South Africa, 2016) The Leopard's New Spots is a documentary film about one man's mission to halt the alarming decline in southern Africa's leopard populations due to a widespread skin trade. Traditionally, only the Zulu royals have been allowed to wear leopard skins. However, in the last three decades the Shembe Church, a four million strong religious group, has adopted the skins into their ceremonial costume. The demand for leopard skins is now astronomical. Because the use of skins is so wide spread and culturally entrenched, law enforcement seems helpless to police this trade in a protected species. It has become, in one researchers words, 'a major conservation blind spot'. Leopard researcher Tristan Dickerson believes that you can't save the leopard without the support of the Shembe people. The film follows Dickerson as he travels from the heart of leopard country to the heart of Shembe and Zulu culture in an effort to discover a solution that benefits all parties. His best solution turns out to be fake fur. Bad fakes are commonly used by church members while they save for the expensive real thing. Dickerson believes that if he can produce a high quality, affordable fake fur, and gain the endorsement of the powerful leader of the Church he can turn the tables in favour of the leopard.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Quirky Science</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Singapore) Mankind has been flying for over a century. As early as the 1500s Leonardo da Vinci tried to build a flying machine. Drawing inspiration from birds he gave it wings. Unfortunately, his "Ornithopter" didn't work, and indeed, the airplanes of today do not have flapping wings! We also tried it with balloons. Huge 245-metre long airships that needed the guts of between 80,000 to 200,000 cows! But, it was the kite that became the forerunner of the flying machine. A kite made by the now famous Wright brothers. The two brothers were bicycle repairmen, which convinced them that a flying machine could be highly unstable and yet controllable, such as with bicycles. They built their kites as strong as their bicycle frames and used bicycle parts to test their workings. The early Wright planes could manage no more than 65 km/h. Nowadays, a commercial plane can top 800 km/h. What is it that make our current planes fly 12 times faster? Well, one British Royal Air pilot, Frank Whittle, remembered his school experiments with the 'Aeolipile', a piece of ancient Greek engineering. This pilot argued that we could fly faster – if we'd fly higher - because there is less air resistance at high altitudes. The future of aviation has lead to Airbus's A380, the largest passenger plane in the world as well as the scramjet built by NASA. So what will be the next quirky discovery for flight?</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Quirky Science</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Singapore) Cooling is more than a luxury. Nowadays it is a necessity. Without refrigerated shipping and stocking, fresh food wouldn't reach our supermarket so easily. Can you imagine living without it? Before the invention of the refrigerator, icehouses were used to provide cool storage for most of the year. To cool our food and beverages, blocks of ice were simply cut out of frozen lakes and shipped to far and beyond. The so-called "ice-industry" came to its end when, in the late 1900s, our waters became too polluted to serve as a cool preserving agent. Air-conditioning, on the other hand, was actually invented to control the humidity that was ruining the paper of printing offices, rather than the technology being used to cool you off. The quirky part is, you can't create cold; you can only "move" temperature form one place to another. The first one to find a technology that cooled the inside of a box - the forefather of the refrigerator - was a medical doctor. In fact, he thought he was building a machine to cure malaria. And yet it took over a century after that, before people started using refrigerators, because refrigerators were thought to be dangerous. And they had a point! For a few decades, the refrigerator was something of a killer machine (literally) as they omitted toxic gases that poisoned people… Even Einstein got worried and developed a cooling-machine. And when refrigerators stopped killing people, scientists discovered that refrigerants were harming the environment. All sorts of chemicals have passed through our refrigerator coils, to be discarded… but perhaps we have a new solution: cooling with the vibrations of sound. That does sound cool.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Canada, 2016) Canadians' attention has been briefly grabbed by the headline: the story--an abnormally high number of overdose deaths caused by a drug called fentanyl. It merited a few days attention and then was pushed off the stage by other concerns. What Canadians failed to appreciate was that those few headlines offered a foreboding glimpse of what might be one of the most destructive waves of illegal drugs to hit North America since Pablo Escobar flooded the continent with cheap and powerful cocaine. Fentanyl is a killer. And fentanyl isn't just preying on the addict population of this country. Its victims are also Canada's unsuspecting middle-class. And the epidemic is showing no signs of letting up. In fact all signs point to the death count rising as more and more powerful versions of this drug seep into the country.The result, Canadians have no idea what's "slouching" towards them in the near future. Through the eyes of four insiders in the fentanyl industry, Dam Builder Productions will take the audience inside this world in way that will enlighten, outrage, and even fascinate.</desc>

Only the strongest of men can endure the harsh work, as well as the long months of isolation on the uninhabited islands. The stench of the excrement is difficult to bear, and the acidic dust burns the lungs. 360° - GEO followed the workers who collect the guano. A documentary on the islands of suffering.</desc>

Some communities live with Tornadoes by building homes with survival features and rather than get out of their paths, they rely on warning systems and classifications. And behind all great weather events is Wind, find out how and why it can change from a gentle breeze into a devastating gale force and where does it go? Nature's force can be mystical and puzzling and the Sunshower has been the subject of myths and legends and superstitions, but it does have a scientific explanation.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Germany, 2011) 17 year old Ester and her dog Mia have big plans: saving lives at Lake Garda. In the north of Italy swimming rescue dogs are on duty at several lakes and the Mediterranean Sea. After traffic accidents, drowning is worldwide the second most common cause of death by accident. But a rescue is always difficult as the rescuer itself can be in danger. Like Mia, the Italian rescue dogs are mostly Newfoundland's- dogs who love the water and with a weight of at least 66 pounds (30 Kilo?), are able to pull people out of the water. For 3 years the dog- owners and their animals are trained to save lives. But the biggest challenge for Ester waits at the end: a jump out of a helicopter.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(France, 2012) How do our brains carry out the process of reading? A professor emeritus guides us through this fascinating exploration of a high-precision neural mechanism. The film structures itself around a central question we ask as an enigma: how to reconcile the cultural singularity that is reading, developed recently by our single species, with the slow pace of genetic evolution, and therefore with the fixity of brain biology?
Stanislas Dehaene proposed an astonishing scientific hypothesis: neuronal recycling. In other words, our cultural inventions, such as reading, resulting in the diversion of pre-existing brain function.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(SAD, 2021) Amerika je možda zemlja slobodnih i dom hrabrih, ali sa 17 tisuća civilnih ubojstava godišnje, ima još jedan slavni nadimak, a to je Nacija ubojica. Istinski obožavatelji krimića gledat će dokumentarni serijal "Nacija ubojica" zbog prikaza policije i ključnih svjedoka, stručnih uvida i dokaza, visoko stiliziranim dramatizacijama i pravim fotografijama mjesta zločina kako bi se ispričale priče o šokantnim ubojstvima. U prvoj sezoni "Nacije ubojica" prolazimo kroz opasno podnožje Louisiane Bayoua, gdje tijela trunu u mutnim močvarama, kako bismo istražili jezivo ubojstvo s predumišljajem i najsmrtonosnijeg serijskog ubojicu u povijesti tog područja. Izvan sezone na poznatim pješčanim plažama Jersey Shorea otkrivamo da korupcija i ljigavost koštaju živote u Atlantic Cityju i ispitujemo slučaj ubojice koji vreba najekskluzivnije enklave napuštene obale.</desc>

Istražujući borbu za preživljavanje i napredak u poslu kojim su nekoć dominirali muškarci, serija je ukorijenjena u povijesnom i društvenom kontekstu rock ere, ali promatrana iz osobnih perspektiva najvećih rock umjetnica koje dijele svoje intimne priče, svoje inspiracije, težnje i motivacije. U svakoj epizodi pratimo zvijezde uključujući Chaku Khan, Pat Benatar, Mavis Staples, Shaniu Twain, Sheryl Crow i Nancy Wilson, uz doprinose zvijezda Tori Amos, Tegan &amp; Sara, Kate Pierson i mnogih drugih. Izvršni producent serije je slavni modni dizajner i glazbeni poduzetnik John Varvatos, a režirala ju je jedna od vodilja rocka, glazbena kritičarka i autorica Jessica Hopper.</desc>

Kriminalistički istražitelj ne koristi uobičajene metode kako bi uhvatio zločince i riješio slučaj pa uz sebe želi samo ljude kojima beskrajno vjeruje.

    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) RTL na male ekrane donosi "Sudnicu" - svjetski uspješan format koji će zadovoljiti apetite širokog gledateljstva najzanimljivijim primjerima iz domaće sudske prakse! Teško je i naslutiti kakvi se sve slučajevi iz grane obiteljskog prava skrivaju na policama sudskih arhiva: najbizarniji oblici bračnih nevjera, nesmiljene borbe za skrbništvo nad djecom, borba za naslijeđe nekad idiličnih parova, samo su neke od tema koje obrađuje "Sudnica". Uloge boraca za svoja prava dodijeljene su "običnim" ljudima bez glumačkog iskustva, dok će slučajeve voditi osobe iz pravne struke, što emisiji daje dodatnu uvjerljivost. Sudnicom uvjerljivo vlada sudac Ivan Gajski - markantan muškarac velikog iskustva, strpljiv, staložen i prije svega pravedan. Spreman je donijeti odluku koja ne oduševljava njegovu okolinu, a u tome je odlučan i nepokolebljiv. Optužba i obrana u rukama su fantastičnih odvjetnika: Barbare Gabrić i Matije Jurlina. Barbara Gabrić mlada je i atraktivna odvjetnica u usponu karijere i za svoju se stranku bori s puno žara, a nerijetko preokrene tijek suđenja iznošenjem novih informacija za trajanja samog procesa. Matija Jurlin, pak, ispunjava show svojom neiscrpnom energijom. Taj odlučni odvjetnik ne preže ni pred čim kako bi dokazao i potkrijepio tvrdnje svoje stranke pa su mu verbalna prepucavanja i nadmudrivanja s odvjetnicom Gabrić poseban izazov. Od svjedoka suprotne strane ponekad u zadnji tren izvlači informacije korisne za svog klijenta.</desc>

Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Rusija) Ovaj simpatični animirani serijal govori o djevojčici Maši i Medvjedu, koji nije baš pričljiv, ali ima jako puno razumijevanja za znatiželjnu i nestašnu Mašu. Njih dvoje postaju najbolji prijatelji i zajedno prolaze razne avanture, uče i druže se. Maša je u stvari hiperaktivna djevojčica velikog i dobrog srca, koja se u jednom trenutku izgubila u šumi i slučajno naletjela na Medvjedovu kuću. On joj je pružio utočište i nastavio se brinuti o veseloj Maši. Medvjed je dobroćudan i miran, voli organiziranost, red i mir pa mu ponekad Maša, koja mu je skroz suprotna tako razigrana i znatiželjna, ide na živce. Ponekad njihov odnosi dolazi na kušnju, ali na kraju se sve dobro završi zahvaljujući dobrom Medvjedu, koji će u svakom trenutku Mašu pokušati zaštititi i zaustaviti u nevjerojatnim idejama.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Torta Makarana, Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

U savremenom svijetu arhitekti pomjeru granice mogućeg koristeći nove moderne tehnologije koje su im na raspolaganju, čime mijenjaju svoju okolinu i daju svojoj novu dimenziju svojoj profesiji. U šest dijelova ovog zanimljivog serijala upoznaćemo arhitekte koji koriste dizajn kao oblik aktivizma i otpora u borbi protiv svjetske urbane, ekološke i socijalne krize. U ovoj epizodi putujemo kroz naselja i predjele okupirane Zapadne obale gdje nam poznati izraelski arhitekta Eyal Weizman objašnjava ključnu ulogu arhitekture na ovom području kao jedan od vidove pritiska zvaničnog Izraela na palestice gdje sa svojim arhitektonskim riješenjima čine sve da bi palestincima svakodnevni život bio još teži.</desc>

Prema rezultatima nedavne studije, broj smrtnih slučajeva mogao bi porasti desetostruko do 2050. godine. Bez moćnih antimikrobnih lijekova ovi "supermikrobi" mogli bi svake godine ubiti do 10 miliona ljudi. Film govori o tome kako smo se doveli u ovu situaciju: kako su nemar, pohlepa i kratkovidnost uzrokovali gubljenje spasonosnih učinaka antibiotika. Ovo je naučni triler o vrijednim ljekarima razočaranim u sistem, buntovnim naučnicima, pacijentima koji se bore sa smrtonosnim bolestima i diplomatama koji tragaju za globalnim rješenjem.</desc>

    <title lang="si">Spomini</title>
    <desc lang="si">(Aleš Jan, 2. del, Slovenija, 2024) Spomini režiserja Aleša Jana skozi osebne zgodbe in pripovedi staršev predstavljajo kroniko slovenskega gledališča zadnjega stoletja, saj gre za že tretjo generacijo z gledališčem povezane družine Juvan-Jan. V oddajah je ob več kot tisoč fotografijah predstavljeno izjemno obsežno filmsko, televizijsko in slikovno dokumentarno gradivo, odlomki več kot pol stoletja starih gledaliških predstav in posnetki dogodkov zadnjega stoletja, od katerih so mnogi prvič objavljeni, večine pa že več desetletij ni bilo mogoče videti. Režiser Aleš Jan, rojen v Ljubljani med vojno leta 1943, je režiral v vseh slovenskih gledališčih. Hkrati je bil režiser in urednik igranega programa na Radiu Slovenija, kjer je ustvaril izjemno število radijskih iger, izmed katerih so bile mnoge nagrajene na mednarodnih festivalih. Na Akademiji za gledališče, radio, film in televizijo je predaval radijsko režijo. Aleš Jan je že od malega preživljal čas v okrilju Drame Slovenskega narodnega gledališča v Ljubljani, kjer sta vse od dvajsetih let preteklega stoletja do konca svoje gledališke poti ustvarjala njegova starša, igralka Vida Juvanova ter igralec in režiser Slavko Jan, kar dvakrat tudi ravnatelj Drame. Že od zgodnjih petdesetih let preteklega stoletja sta bila tudi profesorja na AGRFT, kjer je Vida Juvanova v svet gledališča popeljala mnoge generacije slovenskih igralcev, med njimi največja imena naših odrskih desk, filma, radijskega in televizijskega igranega programa. Tako Vida Juvanova kot Slavko Jan sta zelo zaznamovala tudi slovenski film. V ljubljanski Drami je bila zelo priljubljena igralka med obema vojnama Polonca Juvanova, babica Aleša Jana. Z možem je po vojni postavila Hišo Polonca v Cerkljah na Gorenjskem, ki je postala zbirališče umetnikov in kulturnikov tistega časa.</desc>

Obenem smo se vprašali, kako danes razumemo slovenske klasike: kot resnobneže ali kot nekoga, ki mu dovolimo, da stisne kakšen tvit? Zatem smo se na Wolfovi ulici pod oknom Primičeve Julije srečali s psihoterapevtko dr. Veroniko Podgoršek, s katero smo se pogovarjali o tematiki in pomenu neuslišane ljubezni. Skozi oddajo smo spremljali iskrive izjave slovenskih kulturnikov o tem, kaj jim pomeni Prešeren.</desc>

Zaradi skokovitega razmaha digitalnih tehnologij in nuje po prehodu na zeleno energijo je namreč potreba človeštva po dragocenih kovinah vse večja, zato nekatera podjetja v sodelovanju z znanstveniki že dolgo razvijajo tehnologijo za izkopavanje teh rud na nebesnih telesih. V dokumentarni oddaji strokovnjaki, raziskovalci in podjetniki spregovorijo o izzivih, priložnostih ter nevarnostih morebitnega rudarjenja v vesolju.</desc>

Na Inštitutu za slovenski jezik Frana Ramovša slovaropisci zbirajo in izbirajo besede že več kot sedemdeset let. Najprej v tiskanih izdajah Slovarja slovenskega knjižnega jezika, danes pa je v spletnem portalu Fran, ki je dostopen vsem, zbranih kar 40 slovarjev in drugih jezikovnih virov. Lani pa so bili še posebej ponosni na Slovar slovenskega knjižnega jezika 16. stoletja, ki je nastajal skoraj 50 let. "Slovarji so ogledalo časa", pravijo ustvarjalci slovarjev - zbiralci in izbiralci besed. Z njimi smo razmišljali o tem, zakaj imajo besede tako veliko moč, da nas lahko razveselijo in prizadenejo, kaj pomenijo izbrane besede leta, kako nastajajo nove besede, zakaj se besede s časom spreminjajo, katere nove so nastale v času pandemije novega koronavirusa. S Kozmo Ahačičem, predstojnikom Inštituta pa smo se spraševali, kako je slovaropisje povezano z vzgojo psa, ali imajo jezikoslovci najljubše besede, katera beseda se ga je v zadnjem času najbolj dotaknila, kako je glasba povezana z jezikom.

    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija, 2023) V zabavnem kvizu trije tekmovalci odgovarjajo na enostavna vprašanja. Rešitev je zmeraj črka, ki se izpiše v križanki. Naslednja naloga je rešiti gesla v tej skrivnostni križanki. Tekmovalci lahko v vsakem trenutku zaključijo krog, če prepoznajo vsa gesla naenkrat. V finalu si nato najboljši tekmovalec izbere naključnih 5 črk, ki se izpišejo v čisto novi križanki. Vsaka beseda, ki jo ugane, prinese nagrado. Če mu uspe križanko rešiti v celoti, pa se nagrada poveča in finalist dobi vstopnico v naslednjo oddajo, kjer se pomeri z novima izzivalcema.</desc>

In prijetno presenečeni ugotavljamo, da navdihujočih zgodb kar ne zmanjka. Tokratna se odvija na Goričkem, natančneje v Motovilcih, kjer si je svoje novo ognjišče zakuril karizmatični kuharski mojster Bine Volčič. V novejši večstanovanjski stavbi v Ljubljani so skupni hodniki zasnovani tako, da hkrati povezujejo ter ločujejo ‒ in sicer v obliki mostov, ki ustvarjajo zračen, lahkoten in svetel ambient. Inovativno in posebno pa je tudi eno od stanovanj, ki ima poleg rdeče niti še zeleno. In zakaj ravno zeleno? Ker so kotički v njem premišljeno opremljeni z rastlinami, zaradi manjše kvadrature pa tudi s številnimi drugimi praktičnimi rešitvami. V starejši ljubljanski stavbi sta arhitekta prenovila 65 kvadratnih metrov veliko mansardno stanovanje v sodobno urbano bivališče. Stanovanje ima sicer lepe razglede, nima pa balkona ali terase - in za pristen stik z naravo so poskrbeli z edinstveno zeleno oazo v spalnici.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Anglija, 2021) Posadka se trudi čim prej spet zagnati reaktor. Kriminalistka Silva najde dokaz, ki govori v prid njeni teorijo o umoru. Toda ta teorija pri večini članov posadke še vedno ni dobrodošla. Silvo preganjajo spomini na smrt njenega zaročenca. Kapitan korvete prizna, da je Burka udaril, vendar Silva dvomi, da je bil udarec usoden. Z Burkovim nekdanjim dekletom, aktivistko Jade, se dogovori za srečanje, toda Jade nenadoma doživi nesrečo.</desc>
