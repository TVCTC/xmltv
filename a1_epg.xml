    <title lang="hr">Gannets - The Wrong Side of the Run</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(South Africa, 2010) At the tip of Africa two oceans collide, creating one of the most productive eco-systems on the planet. Here, one of the largest shoals of fish known to man form the basis of two food chains that split and extend for 100's of miles. After the sardines part at Cape Agulhas, each shoal passes it's own critical point. On the west coast of Africa, this is Malgas Island, a traditionally energetic hub of life dominated by the presence of the supreme sardine hunter, the Cape gannet. On the opposing coast, the shoals pass Bird Island, the eastern equivalent of Malgas. Circumstances on the two bird colonies are very different; on the west we see dwindling numbers of sardine, whilst on the east, Bird Island is the inverse. While the Malgas Gannets battle to raise chicks amid skirmishes by Kelp gulls and hungry seals, the Bird island gannets move to intercept huge volumes of sardines. What transpires is one of the greatest marine feeding events on the planet, and in these two parallel scenarios, we see how one environment is mutating under pressure, while the other experiences a bumper season. Will the gannets of Malgas island adapt to their changing world? Can the disappearing sardine stock survive, and in turn support the wide array of marine predators that rely heavily on it. The breath-taking landscape, action and predation sequences are strengthened by solid natural history behaviour with an environmental comment.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(France, 2015) "Floods" is a film dedicated to the memory of those victims of the great floods like those of New York, Bangkok and Xynthia.

This film takes us from New York to Tokyo and Bangkok, visiting Shanghai, the Netherlands and Germany on the way. Throughout the world, oceanographers, coastal engineers, geologists, economists, architects and insurance companies cooperate to understand, anticipate and create a strategy of sustainable protection systems. The relationship between man, his cities and its environment is entirely being redefined. A global and multidisciplinary approach is needed to push boundaries and convince political authorities to act now, to save entire regions from flood threat.</desc>

Island do not get much more remote than this. It is situated 2,000 kilometers from the African coast and 3,000 kilometers from the South American Coast. You can see why it was chosen as a place of exile for the French emperor Napoleon.It is all but impossible to escape from St. Helena. Even today, the only connection to the outside world is by ship, given that the island has no airport. About 4,000 people or "Saints" as they refer to themselves, brave the solitude and live on the island.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Nature's Games, Australia, 2020) Seg 1 Carrion flowers. Carrion flowers are the unorthodox perception of flowers for they are rare, big, and very unpleasant. Other terms are stink flowers and corpse flowers. The biggest flower in the world, rafflesia arnoldii, is a carrion flower. These flowers are difficult to find and reproduce and could breed through cross-pollination by attracting flies and dung beetles. Seg 2 Aposematism. Aposematism is a form of signalling that enables protection for both preys and predators by giving signs of poison and danger through showing off the bright colors and patterns on their epidermal layers that become associated with inedibility. Some species have developed mimicry based on aposematism in order to avail the protection aposematic colors give. Seg 3 Cuckoo Misdirection. Cuckoo misdirection demonstrates the mimicking abilities of a female cuckoo in order to find host nests to hatch her eggs. The female mimics a cry of a predator bird in order to frighten the hosts, leaving them vulnerable, thus the cuckoo can seize the chance to drop her egg on a host nest. Seg 4 Pheromones. Animal pheromones are the chemicals secreted and released by different species to communicate with other organisms. There are various types serving different purposes, ranging from reproduction, to trailing, to alarms. Some pheromones are also specific to one species of animals. Seg 5 Deimatic Behavior. Deimatic behavior is another type of defensive behavior in animals that also involves mimicry. It's the opposite of aposematism because while aposematism works by blatantly showing or signalling its danger or unpalatability, deimatic behavior relies on the element of surprise to startle predators in
order for species to flee to safety.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Perception, Australia, 2020) Seg 1 Saccadic Eye Masking. Saccadic eye movements are characterized as the fast movement of eyes when perceiving motion. These are so fast that they are blurred. To compensate for the blurriness, our brains mask these blurred visions to help us see a completed albeit masked version of sight. Seg 2 Plant Movement. While plants do not exhibit movement for locomotion or moving from place to place, they still exhibit
movement in response to different stimuli. These movements are plant adaptations for food production, plant reproduction and survival. Seg 3 The Language of Color. Language plays a major role in how people from different parts of the world perceive color. The fact that some languages completely lack terms for some colors that other languages have come to know offers insight on how much influence it has on the way people see colors. Seg 4 Color Blindness. Color blindness is the condition that makes people not able to properly see and perceive colors. Color blindness is the result of damaged or underdeveloped rods and cones. these are the light sensitive cells that can be found in the part of our eyes known as the retina which are responsible for seeing colors. Color blindness can either be genetic or caused by sustained damage to the retina over time. Seg 5 Perspective Illusion. This is a technique used in illustrations to render scenes and objects in 3 dimensions with depth and foreshortening. The technique was pioneered by Italian painters during the renaissance period. It involves drawing objects with reference to points measured from a constant line of sight.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Quirky Science</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Light, Singapore, 2015) In contrast with popular belief, Edison did not invent the light bulb. Many people contributed to the invention. Mind you, the first lamp was invented around 70,000 BC. Once upon a time we had limelight, which was actually quite unsafe, and then there were arc "arc lamps" – shedding light that blinded movie stars up to the point where they had to wear sunglasses. What Edison did was improve the light bulb to become a practical, affordable and safe product. He tested over 5000 filaments to make the bulb last: from bamboo fiber to a hair out of an assistant's beard. At the same time others were working on light bulbs made with gasses, which we now know as energy efficient lamps. Modern-day lighting innovations are quite startling, a lot of them - we can't even see with the naked eye… Lasers, for example. For the longest time it was merely a pet-theory of the grand Einstein. Nobody knew what to make of this idea that "atoms could release their excess energy as light" When the laser was invented, people joked that the laser was 'a solution looking for a problem'. Now it is omnipresent. In the near future: laser-light therapy by flashing the human brain.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Telephony, Singapore, 2015) A man with an ear for music, one of the first to try teaching the deaf how to speak, thought he could build a "harmonic telegraph". He had this idea that several notes could travel through a wire simultaneously, instead of the one Morse code that the telegraph could transmit. He thought this to be possible because he misinterpreted the writings of a researcher writing in German – a language he did not know. – And would later describe his misinterpretation as a "very valuable blunder". The man was Alexander Graham Bell and he invented telephony. The big question is: what happens in that wire? How can voices travel? Bell and his assistant eventually proved that different tones would vary the strength of an electric current in a wire. In fact, it's the vibrations of the voice that determine the strength of the current. His invention caused a lot of fuss – yet it took years before people comprehended the scale of it: before the widespread use of the phone – whom were you going to call? Eventually, the telephone, or better said, its wiring, leads to the Internet. Nowadays we mostly make our calls "wireless" so the wire Graham Bell used to make voices travel over long distances is no longer needed How does that work? Even wireless calling, some say, is actually a very unnatural way of communicating. Looking at the future, are we heading towards a "phoneless" call?</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Roll on Cinema</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(France, 2011) This film endeavours to show how the invention of cinema was in no way inevitable, and how it may well have been a mere accident. To pinpoint the start, it all began in the heart of Paris, in the depths of darkened room, on 28 March 1798, when Etienne-Gaspard Robertson gave one of his first screenings of his "Fantasmagoria" - making ghosts and spectres dance. But how did we move from perfecting the magic lantern to the cinematography of the Lumière brothers? The invention was born throughout the 19th century, out of the unpredictable crossing of two parallel research paths - that of philosophical toys and the photography of movement. Originally-named optical devices - such as the kinesigraph, the zoetrope, the praxinoscope and the phenakistoscope, without forgetting the photographic revolver or gun - associated the realm of toys with the realm of thought, reflecting both a fascination for the magical effects produced by animation and speed, and a desire to understand human anatomy, and analyse the phenomenon of vision. All these pre-cinema optical devices literally stemmed from a desire for spectacle and the will to acquire knowledge. Robertson, Reynaud, Plateau, Muybridge and Marey spearheaded the adventure. Thanks to these brilliant inventors, we travel across the 19th century, ending in Paris in 1895 in the Salon Indien du Grand Café, where the first public movie screening took place.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Germany, 2010) 360° GEO- Report visits the Nenets, the last true nomads on earth, on their remote Russian peninsula. Every August, on the Russian polar peninsula of Yamal, children of reindeer shepherds await a helicopter that will bring them back to school after the summer holidays. For the main part of the year, 600 nomad children from the indigenous people of the Nenet live and learn separated from their parents. Up until now, their home Yamal was an of Russia that was far from any semblance of civilization- until an enormous gas pool was discovered beneath the tundra. Now, destroyed nature and gigantic industrial plants are a common sight along the nomad's track - but this industrial development is also offering new opportunities to their children.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Creative Killers</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Trenches, South Africa, 2015) On the plains of East Africa an epic journey is underway. Millions of wildebeest and thousands of zebras march in an annual, circular migration in search of lush grazing.Two major rivers, the Mara and the Grumeti, intersect their route and force the herds to cross. Crocodiles, the biggest living on earth, wait in these rivers to take advantage of this moving feast. In this ever-changing waterscape successful predators adapt their hunting strategies to suit the shifting environment.On the Grumeti River, DC is the Dominant Croc of a lose gang called the RagTags. When the wildebeest arrive to drink, these Pit Stops, Zone 1, are the crocs' first challenge. It doesn't go well for the RagTags. These smaller, inexperienced crocs don't calculate their launch speed correctly, so opportunities are missed. DC finds a pool where he can work alone. He grabs an impressive male zebra, but the pool's not deep enough to drown it. The zebra fights hard and DC is forced to let it go.Deep Water, Zone 2, is a zone exclusive to the Mara River. Steep banks and fast-flowing water make it a river that favours the crocodiles. Wildebeest plunge off the cliffs straight into the deep channel. To hunt here is easy: Swim, launch and drown.There's no free lunch on the Grumeti. DC waits for the next opportunity. He picks up vibrations in the water that tell him the herds have started to cross. Zone 3, The Shallows, is a dangerous zone for crocodiles. Wildebeest gallop across the river and crocodiles can get trampled. DC captures a calf but the RagTags share with him and DC is left with a single mouthful. Frustrated with his small portion, DC drives the gang away. Theft is a viable strategy in the Grumeti. The RagTags follow DC when he tries to hoard his next prize. When DC spots one of the gang members and gives chase, the RagTags move in and steal the carcass.DC finds another opportunity on the Rocks, Zone 4. Wildebeest are forced to walk slowly to avoid tripping and falling. DC causes panic in the ranks and grabs a calf.This time he won't share. He flicks the calf until the head tears right off the neck. Exhausted from the hunt, DC is forced to rest and recharge. He's not alone. This pool belongs to a hippopotamus. Luckily the hippo is more curious that confrontational and he leaves DC alone. As the season moves on, the Grumeti River dries up. Only the tail-enders of the herd remain and DC needs one last kill before the herds disappear for good.On the Mara River the water itself is so treacherous that many animals die while crossing. Carcasses pile up on the riverbank, and the crocs here can scavenge long after the wildebeest have left. DC will have to hunt if he wants a stockpile. When the herds unexpectedly drink at the hippo pool, DC sets up for a Pit Stop attack. But suddenly they start to cross and it becomes a Rock Crossing!Wildebeest trample over him but he strikes a big wildebeest bull and holds tight. The hippo pool is not deep enough for a quick death. But DC outlasts the wildebeest in the tug-of-war. 


The Mara and Grumeti are two very different hunting grounds that require unique skillsets from the crocodiles. In both these trenches the predators responded to the nuances of the landscape and triumphed.

At the Pit Stops and Rocks, in Deep and Shallow Water they learned to modify their hunting techniques – and thrived. And next year, when the herds return, these quiet waters will once again transform into Predator Zones.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Germany, France, 2010) 360° GEO - Report captures the rough beauty of the Falkland Islands on camera, and plunges into the life of the penguin colonies at the far end of the world.
The Falkland Islands is an archipelago in the South Atlantic, not far from the South American continent. In the 1980's, England and Argentina fought a cruel war for sovereignty. Altogether on both sides, about 1,000 people lost their lives before the Argentinians surrendered. Today, the roughly 700 islands of the British Overseas Territory are once again a natural paradise: thousands of penguins crowd the coast, while the almost 3,000 inhabitants lead a "British way of life" and try to do their best given their economic and territorial isolation, at 12,600 km from London.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(South Africa, 2012) As a new year starts in the heart of Africa, the rainy season has come to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and with it begins a season of plenty and the luxury of permanent and abundant water sources. In South Africa's Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve, a group of rare samango monkeys take advantage of the abundant fruit born by a large Natal fig tree. In Thailand, a group of rhesus macaques have discovered a mango tree, and are busy feeding and stuffing their throat pouches with the fruit. Back in the Okavango Delta, the rains have also brought large buffalo herds back to the Xakanaxa area, the territory of a powerful pride of lions. Life and death are also a close-run thing for young gannet fledglings on their massive breeding colony of 50.000 birds on Malgas Island off the South African coast. As the young birds attempt to spread their wings and take to the air, some end up in the water. Many young animals have to run a gauntlet early on in life, and as a young loggerhead turtle hatches out of its egg and emerges from the sand on a beach in Mozambique, it faces a gruelling journey from its nest on the beach down to the sea. African penguins, too, are adapted to life at sea, but rest, breed and mate on land. Penguins elsewhere in the world face an almost unbelievable challenge to breed and rear their young. When it comes to raising animals, the African plains are no more forgiving than the sub-Antarctic. At this time of year, the Serengeti plains in Tanzania are teeming with herds of wildebeest and zebra with their young. Predators are never far away. In a Thai forest, stingless bees are busy building a cone-shaped nest in a tree, combining forces for the greater good of the colony. Kamfers Dam in South Africa is one of only four breeding colonies of Lesser Flamingos, at times reaching up to 50.000 birds. The sun sets over the spectacular sight of thousands of flamingos, straining the water for food and taking to the air.</desc>

Fascinantna koliko i zabavna, serija od 15 epizoda duhovito se osvrće na neke izume koji su promijenili svijet - od sigurnosnog stakla do čičak trake, od penicilina do botoksa, od klima uređaja do samoljepljivih papirića - i otkriva nesreće, nepažnju i sretne nezgode koje doveli do slučajnih otkrića. Uz znanstvene stručnjake koji kreativno objašnjavaju ove nevjerojatne priče kroz arhivu i stilizirane rekonstrukcije, pogledat ćemo koliko je nevjerojatne tehnologije oko nas rezultat nesreća i ljudske pogreške. S razigranim, brzim tonom, zadivljujućim činjenicama i statistikama, "Ups, promijenio sam svijet" govori nam što je pošlo krivo da bi stvari krenule u pravom smjeru.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Ukradena remek djela</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2017) Ovo je najveći muzej na svijetu… muzej umjetnina ukradenih tijekom stoljeća i nikad ponovno otkrivenih. Ova djela progone noćne more svojih vlasnika i okupiraju dane stotinama policajaca diljem svijeta, kao i nekolicini privatnih agencija; nijedna zemlja ili muzej od značaja ne može tvrditi da je pošteđen. Prema Interpolu, krađa umjetnina je četvrta najveća kriminalna trgovina, nakon trgovine drogom, trgovine oružjem i pranja novca. Kako bi moglo biti drugačije, kada skokovita cijena umjetnina tjera vrijednost nekih slika u desetke milijuna eura? Čini se da je ovaj svijet pun misterija. Sindikati kriminala surađuju sa sitnim kriminalcima, a policiji je više stalo do povrata predmeta nego do uhićenja počinitelja.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Engleska, 2020) Ovaj uvjerljiv, duboko važan film, dokumentira priče preživjelih u jednom od najozloglašenijih koncentracijskih logora Drugog svjetskog rata. Sedamdeset i pet godina nakon oslobođenja, posljednji preživjeli - djeca tijekom interniranja - vraćaju se na mjesto logora i dijele svoja ključna sjećanja. Više od pedeset i dvije tisuće ljudi stradalo je kod Bergena Belsona, uključujući Anne Frank i njezinu sestru Margot. Poznat po svojim užasnim uvjetima, malo se ljudi uspjelo izvući živo, a oni koji su uspjeli uvijek su nosili svoja sjećanja sa sobom. Ovaj snažan film dokumentira njihova razmišljanja, zajedno s onima koji su ih oslobodili, potresnom osjetljivošću, čineći ga uvjerljivim i neophodnim za gledanje.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(SAD, 2018) Od 1977. do 1982. dokumentarna serija "U potrazi za istinom" zarobila je američku psihu svojim jedinstvenim istraživanjem neobjašnjivih fenomena. Naoružan oštroumnom znatiželjom i intelektom, voditelj Leonard Nimoy vodio je gledatelje na tjedno putovanje kako bi odgovorili na neka od najfantastičnijih i najzagonetnijih pitanja koja muče čovječanstvo. Od susreta s NLO-ima do Bermudskog trokuta i Sasquatcha, svaka je epizoda osnažila našu kolektivnu inteligenciju i maštu na dubok i provokativan način. Ponovno osmišljena serija impresivno je putovanje kroz sjecište znanosti i natprirodnog, s prikladnom osobom koja će voditi svoja istraživanja: filmska i televizijska zvijezda Zachary Quinto. Kao i njegov prethodnik, Quinto dijeli intenzivnu znatiželju, um i istinski osjećaj čuđenja, što, u kombinaciji s njegovom svjesnošću o 21. stoljeću, čini ovo ponovno rođenje serije "U potrazi za istinom" svježim i uzbudljivim pogledom na teme koje nas sve drže budnima usred noći.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Engleska) Dokumentarni serijal "Bijeg na selo" donosi nam priču o savršenim domovima za obitelji koje silno žele pobjeći iz užurbanog, pomalo i divljeg života u gradu. Svaka epizoda serijala bavi se jednim parom ili cijelom obitelji koji pokušavaju pobjeći iz grada i u potpunosti svoje živote preseliti na selo. Pridružite se prezenterima u njihovoj potrazi za domom koji zadovoljava sve uvjete, dok istovremeno istražuju prekrasan i jedinstven okoliš svake lokacije koju posjećuju. Ovaj dokumentarni serijal poziva gledatelja da sazna što sve selo ima za ponuditi te ga vodi u skrivene prirodne rezervoare, zanosne povijesne građevine i upoznaje ga s lokalnim životinjskim svijetom.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Engleska) Ovaj dokumentarni serijal koji putuje u svaki dio svijeta priča nam priču o dvadeset i šest hotela u osamnaest zemalja. Od ledenog hotela u Finskoj preko kraljevskog glamura u Indiji pa sve do radnog kaubojskog ranča u Arizoni, raznolikost lokacija koje ćemo posjetiti u ovom serijalu je nenadmašna. Serijal također uključuje i jedinstveni pogled iza recepcije, poput Oberoi koledža u Indiji kojeg svaki zaposlenik tamošnjeg hotela mora pohađati prije nego u njemu započne raditi. Kamere nikada prije nisu ušle u spomenuto sveučilište. Ovaj serijal donosi odgovor na pitanje što je uistinu potrebno kako bi se radilo u najnevjerojatnijim hotelima na svijetu?</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Večera za 5</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska, 2024) "Večera za 5" je zabavna lifestyle emisija natjecateljskog karaktera. Svaki tjedan pet kandidata imat će priliku predstaviti se gledateljima kroz svoje kulinarsko umijeće kao i kroz svoj osobni smisao za estetiku i male trikove aranžiranja stola i samih jela. Osim tradicionalnih hrvatskih specijaliteta, natjecatelji će eksperimentirati i s modernim delicijama od kojih rastu zazubice. Prednost za svakog kandidata je što kuhaju u udobnosti vlastitog doma po svojim receptima, sastavljajući menije i radeći ugođaj po svom izboru. Ono što će im otežati posao je jedno od pravila igre po kojemu kandidati kuhaju za četvero svojih protukandidata koji moraju biti pravedni u ocjenjivanju, ali u isto vrijeme moraju paziti da im pobjeda ne izmakne iz ruku.</desc>

No, Callahan tu neće ostati dugo jer ne postoji nitko sposobniji od njega za sređivanje krizne situacije u kojoj skupina terorista grad ucjenjuje za 2 milijuna dolara kako ne bi nastavila svoj krvavi pohod. Callahanu se pridružuje Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), koja se pokazuje iznimno vještom detektivkom te ga natjera promijeniti prvobitno, ne baš pohvalno mišljenje o njoj.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) RTL na male ekrane donosi "Sudnicu" - svjetski uspješan format koji će zadovoljiti apetite širokog gledateljstva najzanimljivijim primjerima iz domaće sudske prakse! Teško je i naslutiti kakvi se sve slučajevi iz grane obiteljskog prava skrivaju na policama sudskih arhiva: najbizarniji oblici bračnih nevjera, nesmiljene borbe za skrbništvo nad djecom, borba za naslijeđe nekad idiličnih parova, samo su neke od tema koje obrađuje "Sudnica". Uloge boraca za svoja prava dodijeljene su "običnim" ljudima bez glumačkog iskustva, dok će slučajeve voditi osobe iz pravne struke, što emisiji daje dodatnu uvjerljivost. Sudnicom uvjerljivo vlada sudac Ivan Gajski - markantan muškarac velikog iskustva, strpljiv, staložen i prije svega pravedan. Spreman je donijeti odluku koja ne oduševljava njegovu okolinu, a u tome je odlučan i nepokolebljiv. Optužba i obrana u rukama su fantastičnih odvjetnika: Barbare Gabrić i Matije Jurlina. Barbara Gabrić mlada je i atraktivna odvjetnica u usponu karijere i za svoju se stranku bori s puno žara, a nerijetko preokrene tijek suđenja iznošenjem novih informacija za trajanja samog procesa. Matija Jurlin, pak, ispunjava show svojom neiscrpnom energijom. Taj odlučni odvjetnik ne preže ni pred čim kako bi dokazao i potkrijepio tvrdnje svoje stranke pa su mu verbalna prepucavanja i nadmudrivanja s odvjetnicom Gabrić poseban izazov. Od svjedoka suprotne strane ponekad u zadnji tren izvlači informacije korisne za svog klijenta.</desc>

Bageri postaju kistovi, a cvjetovi lavande čine najveću ikad napravljenu repliku nekog umjetničkog djela. U zemlji koja je često povezivana s ratom i konfliktima, "Zvjezdano nebo" postaje simbol kreativnosti, upornosti i ljubavi prema umjetnosti. "The Starry Night" nije samo park, već nada i most ka svjetlijoj budućnosti Bosne i Hercegovine.</desc>

U nekim mjestima, u dubini okupirane Zapadne obale, potpuno razdvaja palestinske zajednice, čime tim ljudima stvara ogromnu prepreku u svakodnevnom životu. Ovaj film donosi svjedočenja ljudi koji su protestovali protiv izgradnje zida, sa lokalnim stanovnicima kao i sa nekim izraelskim i međunarodnim aktivistima.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(Bosna i Hercegovina, 2017) Dokumentarni film Svetlana govori nam o životnim izazovima, kao i neizvjesnostima koje život nosi. Glavni junak filma, Milan, čovjek je koji je na putu od komunizma do kapitalizma skrenuo s tračnica i stjecajem nesretnih okolnosti našao u međuprostoru, u kojem se snalazi na sebi svojstven način. Milanova životna priča veoma je teška, turbulentna, nabijena emocijama i životnim iskustvima koja su nekada bila okrutna prema njemu. Spas od sjećanja na teško djetinjstvo, a poslije i na cijeli život, on pronalazi u konstantnom radu i čekanju Svetlane, osobe koja mu je jedini i pravi - kako on kaže - istinski drug, a, s autorove tačke gledišta, i ugao gledanja iz koje je ispričana ova priča.</desc>

Bageri postaju kistovi, a cvjetovi lavande čine najveću ikad napravljenu repliku nekog umjetničkog djela. U zemlji koja je često povezivana s ratom i konfliktima, "Zvjezdano nebo" postaje simbol kreativnosti, upornosti i ljubavi prema umjetnosti. "The Starry Night" nije samo park, već nada i most ka svjetlijoj budućnosti Bosne i Hercegovine.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Ivan Albreht, Slovenija, 2024) Rodil se je v Dolah nad Idrijo, v župniji Zavratec. Leta 1970 je bil na Sveti Gori posvečen v duhovnika in je tudi edini duhovnik, ki je učil predmet samoupravljanje s temelji marksizma in edini učitelj daleč naokoli, ki je učil tako predmet samoupravljanje s temelji marksizma kot verouk. Nedvomni pričevalec nekega časa. Poznajo ga kot pokončnega človeka s skoraj asketskim življenjem, doslednega, vedno čuječega ocenjevalca trenutnega dogajanja in ljudi, s pogledom, zazrtim v prihodnost.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija, 2024) V zabavnem kvizu trije tekmovalci odgovarjajo na enostavna vprašanja. Rešitev je zmeraj črka, ki se izpiše v križanki. Naslednja naloga je rešiti gesla v tej skrivnostni križanki. Tekmovalci lahko v vsakem trenutku zaključijo krog, če prepoznajo vsa gesla naenkrat. V finalu si nato najboljši tekmovalec izbere naključnih 5 črk, ki se izpišejo v čisto novi križanki. Vsaka beseda, ki jo ugane, prinese nagrado. Če mu uspe križanko rešiti v celoti, pa se nagrada poveča in finalist dobi vstopnico v naslednjo oddajo, kjer se pomeri z novima izzivalcema.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Brazilija, Anglija, 2022) Na drugi etapi potovanja po Južni Ameriki Simon Reeve raziskuje Brazilijo. Začne globoko v Amazonskem gozdu, pri ljudstvu Vajampi, ki ga ogrožajo sečnja in rudarjenje. Nato mora potovanje zaradi pandemije covida za nekaj časa odložiti. Nadaljuje ga 20 mesecev pozneje v Manausu. Obišče domorodno sosesko, ki je bila v času pandemije prepuščena sama sebi, in na obrobju mesta z znanstvenico lovi netopirje ter razglablja o nevarnostih, ki jih prinaša vse večje poseganje človeka v deževni gozd. Zatem se poda v Rio de Janeiro, ki se spopada s posledicami podnebnih sprememb. Tam obišče siromašno favelo in spozna gospo, ki vodi šolo za zapostavljene otroke. Pot sklene v Atlantskem gozdu, kjer znanstveniki s cepljenjem rešujejo leviče pred izumrtjem.</desc>

    <title lang="si">Osmi dan</title>
    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija, 2024) Priznani hrvaški filozof Srećko Horvat je v Cankarjevem domu odprl nov cikel pogovorov Kritični kabaret, v katerem z vodilnimi svetovnimi intelektualci, pisatelji, ekonomisti in umetniki razpravlja o izzivih sodobnega časa. Med drugim smo ga spraševali o njegovi zadnji knjigi Po apokalipsi, v kateri pojasnjuje, zakaj sta jedrska in podnebna kriza največji grožnji človeštvu, zakaj vojne postajajo nova realnost in kdo so lažni preroki sodobne družbe. Pogovarjali smo se s priznanim bolgarskim pisateljem Georgijem Gospodinovom, ki je nastopil na zaključku festivala Fabula. Predstavil nam je z Bookerjevo nagrado nagrajeni roman Časovno zaklonišče, v katerem odpira vprašanje nostalgičnega vračanja v preteklost kot načina bega pred prihodnostjo. Obiskali smo razstavo Medprostori akademskega slikarja in režiserja Roberta Černelča v ljubljanski mestni galeriji, kjer smo si ogledali tako njegove slike kot videodela. Kako se filmar loti slikarstva, kako slikar filma, kaj imata ta dva medija skupnega in kaj ju ločuje, je le nekaj izhodišč, o katerih smo se pogovarjali z umetnikom. Nina</desc>

To so zgodbe, ki nas nagovorijo in spodbudijo, da se ozremo okoli sebe in se tudi sami vprašamo: koga mi razumemo, tolažimo, bodrimo in kdo nas? Komu zaupamo, s kom delimo težke in lepe trenutke? Kdo je naš najboljši prijatelj? Knjiga, pes, človek? Smo lahko sami sebi najboljši prijatelj? Zakaj ga sploh potrebujemo? Kako pa na prijateljske vezi gleda strokovnjak? O pomenu, trdnosti in roku trajanja prijateljstva, o mejah in tem, kaj z izbiro prijatelja povemo o sebi, razmišlja psiholog dr. Aleksander Zadel, ki pojasni, kdo in zakaj je zares lahko človekov najboljši prijatelj.</desc>

Tudi Regitze očetu ne pove, da je zanosila z Nizozemcem, ki je poročen in ima otroke. Mamina zadnja želja je, da se Jan in Regitze skupaj odpravita na kamino v Santiago de Compostela. Čeprav si prav nič ne želita biti skupaj, vseeno upoštevata mamino željo in se odpravita na 260 km dolgo pot. Prve dni gre vse narobe, veliko je jeze, besnenja in nemoči, saj sta oče in hči tako različna. Med potjo srečujeta najrazličnejše ljudi, s katerimi navezujeta različne odnose. Med njimi je tudi Galicijčan Tito, s katerim se Regitze zbliža, a se je zaobljubil meništvu. Sicer ona ne verjame, da bi jo kdo maral, odkar je zanosila, vsekakor pa bo otroka obdržala, saj verjame, da bo dobra mamica. Prav tako tudi Jan verjame, da se še lahko popravi, in če že ni bil dober oče, bo vsaj dedek, ki bo vedno pri roki. Odlikuje ga odlična igra Danice Ćurčić in Larsa Brygmanna.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija, ZDA, 2019) Film je portret Louisa Adamiča, premalo znanega Slovenca, ameriškega pisatelja in politika, zelo pomembnega v času 2. svetovne vojne. Luis Adamič je bil cenjen gost tudi v Beli hiši. Skozi preiskavo njegove nepojasnjene smrti v ameriškem New Jerseyu leta 1951 film prinaša vpogled v njegovo življenjsko pot in predvsem refleksijo na moderni čas. Stvari, o katerih je pisal Adamič, so še danes aktualne - rasizem, demokracija, sprejemanje imigrantov in vprašanje nacionalne identitete. Film je bil sneman na različnih lokacijah v Sloveniji in ZDA, režirala ga je Nina Blažin,</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Astor Piazzolla: Tango Nuevo, Slovenija, 2017) Astor Piazzolla sodi med največje skladatelje 20. stoletja. Revolucionarno je priredil tango. Z odmikom od tradicionalnega tanga je to argentinsko glasbo s plesišč ponesel v koncertne dvorane po vsem svetu. Tako se je po letu 1955 rodil tango, namenjen poslušanju. Njegov tango, ki so ga tedanji puristi prezirali, so navdihovali jazz, klezmer, Bach, Stravinski in Bartok. Ob 25. obletnici skladateljeve smrti l. 1992 je Daniel Rosenfeld posnel posvetilo, ki obsega še neobjavljene video in tonske posnetke Piazzole, tudi njegove pripovedi iz zasebnega arhiva.

    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija, Hrvaška, Norveška, Belgija, Litva, 2021) Slovensko in hrvaško prebivalstvo ob reki Kolpi so težke življenske razmere od nekdaj združevale. Zdaj njuno sobivanje resno preizkuša ograja, ki je na obmejnem območju postavljena zaradi migrantov. S postavitvijo žičnate ograje se je običajni način življenja ljudi ob slovensko-hrvaški meji ustavil. V čudoviti dolini reke Kolpe se tako vzpostavlja povsem nova dinamika človeških odnosov. Na meji se dviguje žičnata ograja ter povečuje prisotnost policijskih in vojaških mejnih patrulj, ki lovijo migrante in begunce pri prečkanju Kolpe na poti v zahodno Evropo. Ob tem se na območju pojavljajo samooklicani varuhi meje in aktivisti za človekove pravice, lokalno prebivalstvo pa se spopada z iskanjem načina, kako preživeti in ohraniti vezi.</desc>
