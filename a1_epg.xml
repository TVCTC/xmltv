    <desc lang="hr">(France, 2009) 360° GEO - Report observed salt miners in the Peruvian Mountains. This documentary portrays the harsh day-to-day lives of the "Salineros" as they work in a stunningly beautiful South American mountain landscape. The salt mines of Maras are situated in the highlands of the Peruvian Andes at an altitude of about 3.000 meters. They form a vast manmade labyrinth of salt wells. A thousand terraced wells collect the warm salty waters from the mountain. When the water evaporates under the strong sun, on the edges and bottom of the waterholes a precious white crust is left. This is Maras-Salt. To this very day, the descendants of the Incas harvest their "White Gold of the Andes" using this traditional method.</desc>

Other terms are stink flowers and corpse flowers. The biggest flower in the world, rafflesia arnoldii, is a carrion flower. These flowers are difficult to find and reproduce and could breed through cross-pollination by attracting flies and dung beetles. Seg 2 Aposematism. Aposematism is a form of signalling that enables protection for both preys and predators by giving signs of poison and danger through showing off the bright colors and patterns on their epidermal layers that become associated with inedibility. Some species have developed mimicry based on aposematism in order to avail the protection aposematic colors give. Seg 3 Cuckoo Misdirection. Cuckoo misdirection demonstrates the mimicking abilities of a female cuckoo in order to find host nests to hatch her eggs. The female mimics a cry of a predator bird in order to frighten the hosts, leaving them vulnerable, thus the cuckoo can seize the chance to drop her egg on a host nest. Seg 4 Pheromones. Animal pheromones are the chemicals secreted and released by different species to communicate with other organisms. There are various types serving different purposes, ranging from reproduction, to trailing, to alarms. Some pheromones are also specific to one species of animals. Seg 5 Deimatic Behavior. Deimatic behavior is another type of defensive behavior in animals that also involves mimicry. It's the opposite of aposematism because while aposematism works by blatantly showing or signalling its danger or unpalatability, deimatic behavior relies on the element of surprise to startle predators in

    <desc lang="hr">(Perception, Australia, 2020) Seg 1 Saccadic Eye Masking. Saccadic eye movements are characterized as the fast movement of eyes when perceiving motion. These are so fast that they are blurred. To compensate for the blurriness, our brains mask these blurred visions to help us see a completed albeit masked version of sight. Seg 2 Plant Movement. While plants do not exhibit movement for locomotion or moving from place to place, they still exhibit
movement in response to different stimuli. These movements are plant adaptations for food production, plant reproduction and survival. Seg 3 The Language of Color. Language plays a major role in how people from different parts of the world perceive color. The fact that some languages completely lack terms for some colors that other languages have come to know offers insight on how much influence it has on the way people see colors. Seg 4 Color Blindness. Color blindness is the condition that makes people not able to properly see and perceive colors. Color blindness is the result of damaged or underdeveloped rods and cones. these are the light sensitive cells that can be found in the part of our eyes known as the retina which are responsible for seeing colors. Color blindness can either be genetic or caused by sustained damage to the retina over time. Seg 5 Perspective Illusion. This is a technique used in illustrations to render scenes and objects in 3 dimensions with depth and foreshortening. The technique was pioneered by Italian painters during the renaissance period. It involves drawing objects with reference to points measured from a constant line of sight.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Canada, 2016) Canadians' attention has been briefly grabbed by the headline: the story--an abnormally high number of overdose deaths caused by a drug called fentanyl. It merited a few days attention and then was pushed off the stage by other concerns. What Canadians failed to appreciate was that those few headlines offered a foreboding glimpse of what might be one of the most destructive waves of illegal drugs to hit North America since Pablo Escobar flooded the continent with cheap and powerful cocaine. Fentanyl is a killer. And fentanyl isn't just preying on the addict population of this country. Its victims are also Canada's unsuspecting middle-class. And the epidemic is showing no signs of letting up. In fact all signs point to the death count rising as more and more powerful versions of this drug seep into the country.The result, Canadians have no idea what's "slouching" towards them in the near future. Through the eyes of four insiders in the fentanyl industry, Dam Builder Productions will take the audience inside this world in way that will enlighten, outrage, and even fascinate.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Creative Killers</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Trenches, South Africa, 2015) On the plains of East Africa an epic journey is underway. Millions of wildebeest and thousands of zebras march in an annual, circular migration in search of lush grazing.Two major rivers, the Mara and the Grumeti, intersect their route and force the herds to cross. Crocodiles, the biggest living on earth, wait in these rivers to take advantage of this moving feast. In this ever-changing waterscape successful predators adapt their hunting strategies to suit the shifting environment.On the Grumeti River, DC is the Dominant Croc of a lose gang called the RagTags. When the wildebeest arrive to drink, these Pit Stops, Zone 1, are the crocs' first challenge. It doesn't go well for the RagTags. These smaller, inexperienced crocs don't calculate their launch speed correctly, so opportunities are missed. DC finds a pool where he can work alone. He grabs an impressive male zebra, but the pool's not deep enough to drown it. The zebra fights hard and DC is forced to let it go.Deep Water, Zone 2, is a zone exclusive to the Mara River. Steep banks and fast-flowing water make it a river that favours the crocodiles. Wildebeest plunge off the cliffs straight into the deep channel. To hunt here is easy: Swim, launch and drown.There's no free lunch on the Grumeti. DC waits for the next opportunity. He picks up vibrations in the water that tell him the herds have started to cross. Zone 3, The Shallows, is a dangerous zone for crocodiles. Wildebeest gallop across the river and crocodiles can get trampled. DC captures a calf but the RagTags share with him and DC is left with a single mouthful. Frustrated with his small portion, DC drives the gang away. Theft is a viable strategy in the Grumeti. The RagTags follow DC when he tries to hoard his next prize. When DC spots one of the gang members and gives chase, the RagTags move in and steal the carcass.DC finds another opportunity on the Rocks, Zone 4. Wildebeest are forced to walk slowly to avoid tripping and falling. DC causes panic in the ranks and grabs a calf.This time he won't share. He flicks the calf until the head tears right off the neck. Exhausted from the hunt, DC is forced to rest and recharge. He's not alone. This pool belongs to a hippopotamus. Luckily the hippo is more curious that confrontational and he leaves DC alone. As the season moves on, the Grumeti River dries up. Only the tail-enders of the herd remain and DC needs one last kill before the herds disappear for good.On the Mara River the water itself is so treacherous that many animals die while crossing. Carcasses pile up on the riverbank, and the crocs here can scavenge long after the wildebeest have left. DC will have to hunt if he wants a stockpile. When the herds unexpectedly drink at the hippo pool, DC sets up for a Pit Stop attack. But suddenly they start to cross and it becomes a Rock Crossing!Wildebeest trample over him but he strikes a big wildebeest bull and holds tight. The hippo pool is not deep enough for a quick death. But DC outlasts the wildebeest in the tug-of-war. 


The Mara and Grumeti are two very different hunting grounds that require unique skillsets from the crocodiles. In both these trenches the predators responded to the nuances of the landscape and triumphed.

At the Pit Stops and Rocks, in Deep and Shallow Water they learned to modify their hunting techniques – and thrived. And next year, when the herds return, these quiet waters will once again transform into Predator Zones.</desc>

Yet for years, that is precisely what a certain number of political leaders have sought to do, prompting hackers and defenders of freedom to enter the political arena.</desc>

These works haunt the nightmares of their owners, and occupy the days of hundreds of police officers across the world, as well as those of a handful of private agencies; no country or museum of importance can claim to have been spared.
According to Interpol, art theft is the fourth largest criminal trade, after the drug trade, the weapons trade and money laundering. How could it be otherwise, when the soaring price of art propels the value of some paintings into the tens of millions of Euros?
This world appears to be full of mysteries. Crime syndicates rub shoulders with petty criminals and the police care more about recovering the items than they do about arresting the perpetrators.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Wonder</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Phantoms, Australia, 2020) Seg 1 Body Transfer Illusion. The Body Transfer Illusion is the illusion of perceiving another object to be part of your body. This is best exemplified by the rubber hand experiment where in a volunteer is a shown a rubber hand while their real hand is obscured. Both the fake and real hand is subject to the same stimulus and soon the volunteer will perceive the fake hand as theirs. Seg 2 Autokinetic Effect. The Autokinetic Effect is the effect caused by subtle movements in our eyes when looking at dark environments. This causes stationary light sources to be perceived as moving even though they aren't. Seg 3 Moon Illusion. The Moon Illusion is the illusion where the moon appears to change sizes during different periods in time when especially when it appears closer to the horizon in fact the moon's size remains constant. This happens because we are able to compare the moon's size with visual references like trees and buildings when it appears nearer the horizon. Seg 4 Geometric Illusions. Geometric Illusions are illusions that can literally be illustrated on paper. This type of illusions make use of geometric properties of renderings and illustration and make them appear different in terms of points, length and curvature. Seg 5 Stereoscopy. Stereoscopy is the technique where in our eyes are made to perceive two images that make up one whole image. This technique enables us perceive 3 dimensions from 2 flat image sources.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Art Of Illusion, Australia, 2020) Seg 1 Animation. Animation is the process and technique that involves creating the illusion of movement from still drawings and inanimate objects. It is achieved by displaying images with slight variations in a rapid
and successive manner thus making our eyes perceive the illusion of movement. Seg 2 Aviation Illusions. Aviation illusions are the sensory illusions associated with taking flight. When pilots take flight their
vestibular system, the sensory system responsible for balance, is affected by conflicting stimulus from what the pilot sees and feels during flight. Seg 3 Spinning Dancer. The spinning dancer illusion is an illusion that was created by Noboyuki Kayahara. One can either perceive the dancer as spinning clockwise or counter clockwise. This phenomenon is explained by Bistable perception which states that perception can be altered subjectively just by how an object is observed. Seg 4 Mirage. Mirages are a physical optical phenomenon that can be observed when there is a difference in the temperature in the surrounding air of an area. The different temperatures of the air causes light to refract and cause weird distortions when viewed at the correct angle. This can range from weird reflections to distortions and even the appearance of floating objects. Seg 5 Rainbow Formation. Rainbows are formed as a result of sunlight being refracted and reflected by tiny drops of water in the atmosphere. The water droplets act as prism that can split the sun's white light into the spectrum of visible colors thus creating the effect of a colorful rainbow.</desc>

Biologically speaking, this is the richest body of water on our entire planet. The calm waters among the islands are perfect breeding grounds, creatures migrating thousands of miles to spawn their next generation here. Primeval forces draw giants here on an annual migration from frozen northern seas. Other creatures also travel thousands of miles to nest here on tiny dots in the ocean. The sea of Cortez has been relentlessly exploited by man, driving some species to the brink of extinction. Yet this almost land-locked sea also provides evidence of the remarkable resilience of the ocean. And it also shows us how we humans can sometimes make a difference...</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Perception, Australia, 2020) Seg 1 Saccadic Eye Masking. Saccadic eye movements are characterized as the fast movement of eyes when perceiving motion. These are so fast that they are blurred. To compensate for the blurriness, our brains mask these blurred visions to help us see a completed albeit masked version of sight. Seg 2 Plant Movement. While plants do not exhibit movement for locomotion or moving from place to place, they still exhibit
movement in response to different stimuli. These movements are plant adaptations for food production, plant reproduction and survival. Seg 3 The Language of Color. Language plays a major role in how people from different parts of the world perceive color. The fact that some languages completely lack terms for some colors that other languages have come to know offers insight on how much influence it has on the way people see colors. Seg 4 Color Blindness. Color blindness is the condition that makes people not able to properly see and perceive colors. Color blindness is the result of damaged or underdeveloped rods and cones. these are the light sensitive cells that can be found in the part of our eyes known as the retina which are responsible for seeing colors. Color blindness can either be genetic or caused by sustained damage to the retina over time. Seg 5 Perspective Illusion. This is a technique used in illustrations to render scenes and objects in 3 dimensions with depth and foreshortening. The technique was pioneered by Italian painters during the renaissance period. It involves drawing objects with reference to points measured from a constant line of sight.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Rijekama do mora</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2018) Mekong, Mississippi, Dunav, Parana ... Na svim kontinentima postoje mitske rijeke, istinske pozivnice da krenemo prema otvorenom moru. Izvor su najvećih civilizacija, utočište zaboravljenih ljudi, ekonomska i kulturna pluća i fantastični ekosustavi. Francois Pecheux vodi ove rijeke od svojih izvora do njihovih ušća, ciljajući upoznati ljude koji žive na obalama ili na vodi. Oni su ribari, mornari ili farmeri, čuvari povijesti ili nomadi. Od američkih zajednica koje obožavaju Paranu, "roditelja mora", do uzgajivača krokodila na Mekongu, svaka rijeka ima svoju priču. Francois, potpuno otvoren, istraživač avanturist, upada u sve što plovi i rado se zaustavlja na bilo kojem mjestu. U velikim gradovima, u brzacima ili na velikim deltama, koristeći rijeku kao svoju bazu, posjećuje nalazišta i nevjerojatna prirodna područja. Od rezervata prirode na Dunavskom tjesnacu koji je dom velikog broja ptica i divljih konja, do Louisiana Bayousa koji označava kraj Mississippija, samo je jedno što je sigurno: na kraju je more.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(SAD, 2018) Od 1977. do 1982. dokumentarna serija "U potrazi za istinom" zarobila je američku psihu svojim jedinstvenim istraživanjem neobjašnjivih fenomena. Naoružan oštroumnom znatiželjom i intelektom, voditelj Leonard Nimoy vodio je gledatelje na tjedno putovanje kako bi odgovorili na neka od najfantastičnijih i najzagonetnijih pitanja koja muče čovječanstvo. Od susreta s NLO-ima do Bermudskog trokuta i Sasquatcha, svaka je epizoda osnažila našu kolektivnu inteligenciju i maštu na dubok i provokativan način. Ponovno osmišljena serija impresivno je putovanje kroz sjecište znanosti i natprirodnog, s prikladnom osobom koja će voditi svoja istraživanja: filmska i televizijska zvijezda Zachary Quinto. Kao i njegov prethodnik, Quinto dijeli intenzivnu znatiželju, um i istinski osjećaj čuđenja, što, u kombinaciji s njegovom svjesnošću o 21. stoljeću, čini ovo ponovno rođenje serije "U potrazi za istinom" svježim i uzbudljivim pogledom na teme koje nas sve drže budnima usred noći.</desc>

Povijest Gulaga je dugačka, kompleksna i na mnoge načine neuobičajena. Još od velike revolucije 1917. pa sve do vremena Gorbačova, baveći se razdobljima građanskog rata, velikog terora, Drugog Svjetskog rata, Hladnog rata i smrti Staljina, ovaj dokumentarni serijal opisuje kako je funkcionirao Gulag. Kako i zašto je Sovjetski Savez kreirao sistem kampova za prisilni rad u kojem je više od dvadeset milijuna zatvorenika bilo izrabljivano do smrt? Kroz nevjerojatne sudbine nebrojenih protagonista, s jedne i s druge strane (krvnika i zatvorenika) uz nikad prije objavljene dokumentarne izvore i pomoć povjesničara i stručnjaka, ovaj dokumentarni serijal pokušava nam dešifrirati što je zapravo bio Gulag.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2019) Kao velika politička, povijesna, ljudska i gospodarska činjenica kompletnog 20. stoljeća, Gulag, ekstremno oštar sovjetski koncentracijski logor uglavnom ostaje nepoznat. Povijest Gulaga je dugačka, kompleksna i na mnoge načine neuobičajena. Još od velike revolucije 1917. pa sve do vremena Gorbačova, baveći se razdobljima građanskog rata, velikog terora, Drugog Svjetskog rata, Hladnog rata i smrti Staljina, ovaj dokumentarni serijal opisuje kako je funkcionirao Gulag. Kako i zašto je Sovjetski Savez kreirao sistem kampova za prisilni rad u kojem je više od dvadeset milijuna zatvorenika bilo izrabljivano do smrt? Kroz nevjerojatne sudbine nebrojenih protagonista, s jedne i s druge strane (krvnika i zatvorenika) uz nikad prije objavljene dokumentarne izvore i pomoć povjesničara i stručnjaka, ovaj dokumentarni serijal pokušava nam dešifrirati što je zapravo bio Gulag.</desc>

Prije nego što je preuzeo zapovjedništvo nad obavještajnim službama, Voight je radio u jedinici Odjela za suzbijanje djelovanja bandi i njegov je otac bio policajac, ali je ubijen na dužnosti. Voight je udovac, supruga Camille umrla je od raka prije nekoliko godina, sin Justin je u vojsci, dok je Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush), koju je upoznao kada je bila 14-godišnjakinja delikventica, odgojio kao svoju kćer. Danas je Erin detektivka u njegovom odjelu.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Sudnica</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) RTL na male ekrane donosi "Sudnicu" - svjetski uspješan format koji će zadovoljiti apetite širokog gledateljstva najzanimljivijim primjerima iz domaće sudske prakse! Teško je i naslutiti kakvi se sve slučajevi iz grane obiteljskog prava skrivaju na policama sudskih arhiva: najbizarniji oblici bračnih nevjera, nesmiljene borbe za skrbništvo nad djecom, borba za naslijeđe nekad idiličnih parova, samo su neke od tema koje obrađuje "Sudnica". Uloge boraca za svoja prava dodijeljene su "običnim" ljudima bez glumačkog iskustva, dok će slučajeve voditi osobe iz pravne struke, što emisiji daje dodatnu uvjerljivost. Sudnicom uvjerljivo vlada sudac Ivan Gajski - markantan muškarac velikog iskustva, strpljiv, staložen i prije svega pravedan. Spreman je donijeti odluku koja ne oduševljava njegovu okolinu, a u tome je odlučan i nepokolebljiv. Optužba i obrana u rukama su fantastičnih odvjetnika: Barbare Gabrić i Matije Jurlina. Barbara Gabrić mlada je i atraktivna odvjetnica u usponu karijere i za svoju se stranku bori s puno žara, a nerijetko preokrene tijek suđenja iznošenjem novih informacija za trajanja samog procesa. Matija Jurlin, pak, ispunjava show svojom neiscrpnom energijom. Taj odlučni odvjetnik ne preže ni pred čim kako bi dokazao i potkrijepio tvrdnje svoje stranke pa su mu verbalna prepucavanja i nadmudrivanja s odvjetnicom Gabrić poseban izazov. Od svjedoka suprotne strane ponekad u zadnji tren izvlači informacije korisne za svog klijenta.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Veronika Desinić, Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) 'Svijet u nama' je edukativno-zabavni serijal posvećen djeci, ali i roditeljima te format kakav još nismo imali prilike gledati na našem programu. Ovaj put u fokusu je mentalno zdravlje koje je nerijetko zapostavljeno, a prožima svaki djelić našeg bića. U suradnji sa Sandrom Tolić, psihologinjom i psihoterapeutkinjom, otvoreno progovaramo o emocijama, razvoju kritičkog razmišljanja, sigurnosti na internetu, vršnjačkom nasilju, postavljanju granica u odgoju djece, ali i mnogim drugim temama koje će vas prikovati uz male ekrane. Poučnih 15 epizoda serijala šire vidike i otvaraju nove mogućnosti.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Veronika Desinić, Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Svijet u nama</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) 'Svijet u nama' je edukativno-zabavni serijal posvećen djeci, ali i roditeljima te format kakav još nismo imali prilike gledati na našem programu. Ovaj put u fokusu je mentalno zdravlje koje je nerijetko zapostavljeno, a prožima svaki djelić našeg bića. U suradnji sa Sandrom Tolić, psihologinjom i psihoterapeutkinjom, otvoreno progovaramo o emocijama, razvoju kritičkog razmišljanja, sigurnosti na internetu, vršnjačkom nasilju, postavljanju granica u odgoju djece, ali i mnogim drugim temama koje će vas prikovati uz male ekrane. Poučnih 15 epizoda serijala šire vidike i otvaraju nove mogućnosti.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Etno sat</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Lončarstvo, Hrvatska) Serijal od 25 epizoda pod nazivom "Etno sat" bavi se tradicijskom kulturom Hrvatske. Putujući Istrom, Slavonijom, Dalmacijom, Hrvatskim zagorjem i drugim dijelovima Lijepe Naše susretali smo se s kulturnom ostavštinom pojedinih krajeva te doznali kako se ona njeguje i danas. Danas su u tradicijske običaje, plesove i sviranje starih instrumenata dosta uključena i djeca, koja njeguju ostavštinu svojih djedova i baka. Ekipa Etno sata družila se s malim zvončarima iz Viškova, vrsnim plesačicama baluna iz Pazina, prisustvovala je klapskom pjevanju mladih Splićanki i Splićana te posjetila vrtićke alkare i djevojke iz Vrlike koje njeguju ojkanje. Folklorne skupine pokazale su kako se pleše nijemo kolo, linđo, drmeš i slavonsko kolo. Zabilježili smo zvukove mandolina, tamburica, gajda, sopela te naučili izradu licitarskog srca, drvenih igračaka za djecu i šestinskih kišobrana.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(7. oktobar, SAD, 2023) Hamasov napad na Izrael 7. oktobra preobrazio je političku mapu Bliskog Istoka. Istraživačka jedinica Al Jazeere provela je forenzičku analizu dešavanja tog dana, uspoređujući snimke i fotografije s CCTV-a, nadzornih kamera, ličnih telefona i kamera na glavama pripadnika Hamasa. U tom napadu su pripadnici Hamasa, ali i civili koji su ušli na izraelsku teritoriju iz pravca Gaze, prekršili brojna ljudska prava. S druge strane, mnoge od najgorih priča koje su se pojavile u javnosti u danima nakon napada bile su lažne. To se posebno odnosilo na zločine koje su političari u Izraelu i na Zapadu više puta koristili kako bi opravdali žestinu bombardovanja Pojasa Gaze, poput masovnog ubijanja beba i optužbi za rašireno i sistematsko silovanje. Događaji koji su se desili 7. oktobra 2023. trajno su promijenili palestinsko-izraelske odnose, pregovore o mirnom rješavanju sukoba, te za posljedicu imaju desetke hiljada mrtvih, ranjenih i prognanih stanovnika Pojasa Gaze.</desc>

To je priča o Romima koji su svojim radom, trudom i zalaganjem izgradili svoj status, koji ruše predrasude, otvoreno pričaju o svim problemima i jasno poručuju da je obrazovanje najbrži put do uspjeha i da tako najviše mogu pomoći sami sebi. Njihovo razmišljanje nas tjera da promislimo je li konačno došlo vrijeme da se odbace stereotipi o Romima.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(Sarajevo: "Holiday Inn", 2018) Hotel "Holiday Inn" otvoren je u Sarajevu 1984. godine kako bi bio omogućen smještaj posjetiocima tokom Zimskih olimpijskih igara. U vrijeme rata u Bosni i Hercegovini taj hotel postao je tvrđava za svjetske medije koji su pratili sukobe. Iz njega je snimljen značajan broj ratnih videosnimaka i fotografija. "Holiday Inn" i danas stoji, iako pod novim imenom, kao simbol izdržljivosti i hrabrosti stanovnika Sarajeva.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(Bali: Pandemija u raju, Malezija) Prirodne ljepote i kultura Balija dugo su ga činile magnetom za turiste iz cijelog svijeta. No, otkako je pandemija COVID-19 pogodila cijeli svijet, granice su se zatvorile, naglo zaustavivši međunarodna putovanja, otok se bori bez prihoda od turizma. Mještani preispituju svoju ovisnost o turizmu i pretjerani razvoj koji je doveo do zagušenja, zagađenja i problema sa smećem. Neki stanovnici tog otoka žele vidjeti održiviju vrstu turizma kada turisti nakon pandemije počnu ponovno dolaziti. Naša ekipa bila je na Baliju i donosi priču o tome što se događa kada u ovom ''turističkom raju'' nema turista.</desc>

To je ena najpogosteje uprizarjanjih Shakespearovih komedij, v kateri se ukvarja z dvema nasprotujočima si svetovoma: z realnostjo in utopijo. Ogledali smo si tudi novo razstavo projekta Pod lupo, s katerim Umetnostna galerija Maribor povezuje dela iz svoje likovne zbirke z vsebinami drugih institucij. Tokrat z Univerzitetno knjižnico Maribor, kjer so likovna dela na temo knjig dopolnjena z bralnimi, literarnimi in drugimi konteksti.

Če mu uspe križanko rešiti v celoti, pa se nagrada poveča in finalist dobi vstopnico v naslednjo oddajo, kjer se pomeri z novima izzivalcema.</desc>

Pred kratkim je namreč Akademija za glasbo v Ljubljani organizirala mednarodni simpozij na temo inkluzije oz. vključevanja otrok z motnjami avtističnega spektra v glasbene šole. Ob strokovnem posvetu so pripravili tudi koncert, na katerem se je bilo mogoče prepričati o tem, kako lahko s pravilnim usmerjanjem otrok z avtističnimi motnjami odkrijemo njihove največje zmožnosti. V oddaji bodo učitelji, profesorji, mentorji, dijaki in starši spregovorili o tem, s kakšnimi težavami se srečujejo, kako jih premagujejo, kdo jim pri tem pomaga itd. Spoznali bomo, kako delajo s takšnimi otroci v zasebnem glasbenem centru Doremi na Bledu, ter se pogovarjali s starši, ki so svojemu avtističnemu otroku pomagali, da je maksimalno razvil svojo glasbeno nadarjenost.</desc>

    <title lang="si">Kinoteka: Črni Orfej</title>
    <desc lang="si">(Italija, Francija, Brazilija, Portugalska, 1959) Svetovna filmska senzacija s konca 50. let v svet brazilskih favel, bossa nove in karnevala prestavi antični mit o Orfeju in Evridiki Starogrški mit o Orfeju in Evridiki je prestavljen v čas karnevala, ki preplavi ulice favele v brazilski prestolnici Rio de Janeiro. Orfej je mlad vrhunski glasbenik, ki po izginotju Evridike, svoje velike ljubezni, to zaman poskuša oživiti v starodavnem ritualu in jo po svoji lastni krivdi tudi drugič izgubi. Ob nastanku je film z živahnimi ritmi modernega glasbenega sloga bossa nove, slikovito vizualno podobo in nalezljivim karnevalskim vzdušjem navdušil občinstvo po vsem svetu in iz novega glasbenega sloga, ki se je rodil v revnejših družbenih slojih v Braziliji, ustvaril svetovno senzacijo. Čeprav sodi v kanon svetovne kinematografije, so film v zadnjem času kritizirali zaradi evropocentričnega pogleda na življenje v brazilski faveli. Tamkajšnji prebivalci so prikazani kot otroški, nedolžni, senzualni ljudje, ki pojejo in plešejo, družbeno-politični problemi pa v filmu niso navzoči, govorijo kritiki. Kljub temu kritičnemu vpogledu filmu ni mogoče oporekati statusa klasike in mojstrovine v žanru muzikala. Predvsem pa ima film duha, občudovanja vredno muzikaličnost, vitalnost in šarm.</desc>

    <desc lang="si">(Slovenija, 2014) To je zgodba o učitelju, etnologu, pisatelju in politiku Vinku Möderndorferju, o življenju v času revolucij in svetovnih vojn. Vinko Möderndorfer je med ljudmi pustil globoko sled s knjigo Koroške narodne pripovedke. Kot učitelj je poskusil z novim pedagoškim procesom, ki ga je teoretično in praktično utemeljil v dveh knjigah. Menil je, da je treba slovensko šolo postaviti na nove temelje, kjer pedagog ni več avtoritarni trinog temveč resnično učitelj in prijatelj. S svojim bogatim etnološkim opusom je Vinko Möderndorfer brez dvoma tudi eden pomembnih slovenskih etnologov. Politika mu ni bila nikoli naklonjena. Njegovo življenje so spremljali politični procesi in zapori, v socialistični Jugoslaviji so ga celo zaprli na zloglasni Goli otok. Koroška trma in občutek za pravičnost sta mu pomagala preživeti v vseh režimih. Tisti, ki je zgradil šolo, je samo ena izmed mnogih tragičnih zgodb iz prve polovice dvajsetega stoletja, ki je usodno zaznamovalo naš čas.</desc>

S skupnimi močmi so namreč za štirimi zidovi sodobne hiše ustvarili domač, a sodoben dom, ki odraža potrebe in življenjski ritem mlade družine z domačim kosmatincem. Prej ali slej začnejo mladi razmišljati, kako iti na svoje in si ustvariti čisto svoj dom. Ni pa nujno, da zato zapustijo hišo staršev, kajti morda se ravno v njej skriva najboljše razmerje med samostojnostjo in intimo na eni ter finančno vzdržnostjo na drugi strani. Predstavimo vam mansardo, ki je prinesla oboje. Ponaša se z inovativnimi arhitekturnimi prijemi, predvsem pa se po prenovi kopa v dnevni svetlobi. Sledi še en primer, ko si je mlada družina uredila dom v hiši staršev, v nadstropju nekaj desetletij stare hiše. Čez čas, ko prvotna zasnova stanovanja, ki je bilo prepredeno s številnimi stenami in manjšimi prostori, ni več ustrezala njihovim potrebam, so začutili potrebo po temeljiti osvežitvi.</desc>
