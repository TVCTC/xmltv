    <desc lang="hr">(Germany, 2010) 360° GEO- Report visits the Nenets, the last true nomads on earth, on their remote Russian peninsula. Every August, on the Russian polar peninsula of Yamal, children of reindeer shepherds await a helicopter that will bring them back to school after the summer holidays. For the main part of the year, 600 nomad children from the indigenous people of the Nenet live and learn separated from their parents. Up until now, their home Yamal was an of Russia that was far from any semblance of civilization- until an enormous gas pool was discovered beneath the tundra. Now, destroyed nature and gigantic industrial plants are a common sight along the nomad's track - but this industrial development is also offering new opportunities to their children.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">New York - The World's Smallest Opera House</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Germany, France, 2008) "If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere". That's the vision people from all over the world have of New York. This report takes a look behind the scenes of the world's smallest opera house, in the heart of New York. Tony Amato, the son of an Italian butcher, thought when he came to New York in the 40s that he could make it too by realizing his dream of owning an opera house. The house is 3 stories high and three windows wide. The hall feels no bigger than a living room, however its 107 seats are always sold out. Tony Amato continues to be the center and linchpin of this miniature opera. Tony is barely 5 foot tall, with his sneakers and the small, wiry man seems to be held up by his pant-suspenders. His voice is persuasive, his eyes bright. He conducts, sings, jumps, laughs and grumbles all at once. At 88 years of age, Maestro Tony Amato is in the middle of the season's last production.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">The Mystery Of the Disappearing Bees</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(France, Canada, 2010) An investigation into a worldwide ecological disaster that could endanger the whole of humanity. The future of our food resources depends on one small insect - the western honey bee, or Apis mellifera. Indeed, it is the most important agricultural pollinator on our planet given that one third of our food supply depends directly on pollination from bees. This documentary tells the story of a worldwide ecological disaster that has been waiting to happen for several generations. It was filmed over an 18-month period in France, Germany, the U.S., Canada and Scotland and retraces the various leads carried out by research scientists in order to try and understand and to stop the declining numbers of domestic and wild bees. Scientists are not the only professionals to figure at the centre of this drama. Beekeepers are in the front line, and striking contrasts exist among beekeepers' experiences in different countries, in various economic situations. The documentary seeks to understand how the long-enjoyed harmonious relationship between man and bee has now undergone such a radical change. It seeks to find a solution that goes beyond science. A solution that cannot be found without thoroughly re-examining our agricultural practice and our model of society. Can we rise to the challenge?

    <title lang="hr">Looking for Sultan</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(England, 2017) Despite efforts to protect tigers for the past 4 decades, tigers continue to be hunted down - poached, poisoned and squeezed into small pockets of protected forests.Tigers play a pivotal role in maintaining the health of the forest ecosystem and there is an urgent need to protect the tiger and its habitat.In India and across the world, Tigers have captured our imagination for centuries. We have feared them, respected them and even worshipped them. But during the colonial times tigers were hunted in thousands.At the turn of the century over a 100,000 tigers existed on the planet. Almost 40,000 of these were in India. But today only 3800 tigers survive across the world and 70% of these are in India.Today each and every tiger is important and that's why we need to find Sultan.This film follows the story of Sultan, the up and coming dominant tiger of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve who vanished suddenly.Father and son wildlife filmmakers, Mike and Gautam, had been following and filming him since he was a cub and are now trying to put the pieces together to solve this mystery.More than 12 tigers have gone missing in Ranthambhore between 2012 and 2017. Young tigers who go missing are usually thought to have been poached or just lost forever. But the story is much more complicated.Tigers are born in parks and forests - a safe, secure place protected by their mother. But once these tigers mature they must find new homes but the question is where will they go? Trackers on ground have proved that tigers leave the protected territory of national parks to walk great distances in search for new territory. Tigers know no borders and young sub adult tigers must walk hundreds of kilometres to find a new home, prey and a new mate. Once they walk out of the protected area of the forest they are in direct contact with human habitation. People and tigers now share a complicated relationship - one of constant fear of the other.This is the story all across the country. Isolated populations of tigers in small fragmented forests surrounded by human beings and villages. The film looks at broader issues of conservation of tigers and their relationship with the people who share their habitat and the different efforts being made towards conservation in India through the story of Sultan.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Roll on Cinema</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(France, 2011) This film endeavours to show how the invention of cinema was in no way inevitable, and how it may well have been a mere accident. To pinpoint the start, it all began in the heart of Paris, in the depths of darkened room, on 28 March 1798, when Etienne-Gaspard Robertson gave one of his first screenings of his "Fantasmagoria" - making ghosts and spectres dance. But how did we move from perfecting the magic lantern to the cinematography of the Lumière brothers? The invention was born throughout the 19th century, out of the unpredictable crossing of two parallel research paths - that of philosophical toys and the photography of movement. Originally-named optical devices - such as the kinesigraph, the zoetrope, the praxinoscope and the phenakistoscope, without forgetting the photographic revolver or gun - associated the realm of toys with the realm of thought, reflecting both a fascination for the magical effects produced by animation and speed, and a desire to understand human anatomy, and analyse the phenomenon of vision. All these pre-cinema optical devices literally stemmed from a desire for spectacle and the will to acquire knowledge. Robertson, Reynaud, Plateau, Muybridge and Marey spearheaded the adventure. Thanks to these brilliant inventors, we travel across the 19th century, ending in Paris in 1895 in the Salon Indien du Grand Café, where the first public movie screening took place.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Boteti: The Returning River</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(England, 2011) For 20 years the Boteti River in northern Botswana has not flowed. What was once an expansive and prolific body of water gradually dried up, leaving zebras, hippos, elephants and crocodiles dependant on the few pools formed from the occasional rains.But now, for the first time in 30 years, rain has fallen in sufficient quantities hundreds of miles to the north in the Angolan highlands, sending a stream of water through the river bed. After years of extreme drought, the river has finally returned in all its glory, transforming the landscape. Filmed in stunning HD, "Boteti – The Returning River" documents this extraordinary transformation and the dramatic changes it brings to the resident animals.During the years of drought, we see how desperate battles for survival play out along the dormant river, watched over by the elephants of the area. One of the few species that adapts well to the situation by carefully conserving what little water is available, the elephant is an expert at digging channels in the mud so water collects in sufficient quantities to drink.Vultures lurk ominously on the dusty banks adjacent to the pools, waiting patiently for dehydration to claim another victim. Crocodiles use caves to escape the heat of the sun and only emerge reluctantly to hunt when huge flocks of quelea birds arrive at the water. The crocs, along with numerous other species, are bound to this area because there is simply nowhere else to go. Beyond the dry river bed, semi-desert extends for hundreds of miles in all directions.With the arrival of the life-giving waters, there is a burst of activity. Fish and dragonflies soon emerge with their attendant predators and frogs appear in their thousands, attracting huge numbers of birds. The deluge also brings instant relief to the hippos by flushing out their fetid pools, while elephants celebrate by swimming and hosing each other down. Jackals and packs of wild dogs appear from nowhere to harass the drinking herds.But the most significant change occurs when the water reaches the parched wasteland of the Makgadigadi Salt Pans. Here, the coming of the flood sees flocks of pelican, flamingo and red-billed teal arrive to set up new breeding colonies.Filmed over a period of two years, this film provides a lasting and unique record of the transformation of an entire environment and contains many examples of previously unrecorded behaviour.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Quirky Science</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Singapore) In contrast with popular belief, Edison did not invent the light bulb. Many people contributed to the invention. Mind you, the first lamp was invented around 70,000 BC. Once upon a time we had limelight, which was actually quite unsafe, and then there were arc "arc lamps" – shedding light that blinded movie stars up to the point where they had to wear sunglasses. What Edison did was improve the light bulb to become a practical, affordable and safe product. He tested over 5000 filaments to make the bulb last: from bamboo fiber to a hair out of an assistant's beard. At the same time others were working on light bulbs made with gasses, which we now know as energy efficient lamps. Modern-day lighting innovations are quite startling, a lot of them - we can't even see with the naked eye… Lasers, for example. For the longest time it was merely a pet-theory of the grand Einstein. Nobody knew what to make of this idea that "atoms could release their excess energy as light" When the laser was invented, people joked that the laser was 'a solution looking for a problem'. Now it is omnipresent. In the near future: laser-light therapy by flashing the human brain.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Quirky Science</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Singapore) A man with an ear for music, one of the first to try teaching the deaf how to speak, thought he could build a "harmonic telegraph". He had this idea that several notes could travel through a wire simultaneously, instead of the one Morse code that the telegraph could transmit. He thought this to be possible because he misinterpreted the writings of a researcher writing in German – a language he did not know. – And would later describe his misinterpretation as a "very valuable blunder". The man was Alexander Graham Bell and he invented telephony. The big question is: what happens in that wire? How can voices travel? Bell and his assistant eventually proved that different tones would vary the strength of an electric current in a wire. In fact, it's the vibrations of the voice that determine the strength of the current. His invention caused a lot of fuss – yet it took years before people comprehended the scale of it: before the widespread use of the phone – whom were you going to call? Eventually, the telephone, or better said, its wiring, leads to the Internet. Nowadays we mostly make our calls "wireless" so the wire Graham Bell used to make voices travel over long distances is no longer needed How does that work? Even wireless calling, some say, is actually a very unnatural way of communicating. Looking at the future, are we heading towards a "phoneless" call?</desc>

Arenas bathed in a history of blood, places where Africa's icons have hunted successfully for generations. Predators here develop unique and clever ways to hunt. But the circumstances aren't the driving factor in this story. Sometimes these predators look for the perfect patch of ground to kill, a small area of long grass, or a single path that leads to the perfect ambush. How do they amplify their age-old skills by using the lie of the land? Savuti is big cat country. But only the most resourceful cats make it to the top.The Marsh Pride, Savuti's resident lions, is faced with their toughest challenge this winter: Buffalo. The complicated mix of boggy marsh, open plains and dense woodland provide extra obstacles in their path to a meal. Over centuries these heavyweights have adapted their hunting strategy to Savuti's every challenge and the buffalos' every move. And their secret: The nighttime hunt. When the sun sets, the tables begin to turn and Savuti is at the pride's mercy. But there's no shortage of challenges: Saba, the pride matriarch and most experienced hunter, has got to provide for her pride and keep them, and her territory, safe from two young male lions that are trespassing on Marsh Pride territory. It all seems doable until she gets injured after a run-in with hyenas… A lone female leopard is Savuti's ultimate innovator. Her environment has forced her to change her hunting strategy and her prey, and she's thriving!We follow three characters through Savuti's winter, starting with the disappearance of the small game and the arrival of the buffalo. The film looks at how our characters use the environment and features of the landscape to their advantage. We focus on the numerous challenges of Savuti – the things that make it such a hostile place for predators, and also highlight the inter-predatory battles between the Marsh Pride and the Nomads. We look at the challenges the young leopard is faced with while hunting under the lions' radar and trying to survive in her non-leopard-friendly environment.</desc>

For centuries, the codfish brought prosperity to the group of islands, until a French-Canadian agreement prohibited catching it due to overfishing.Today, even the rough beauty of the island nature is threatened - because environmentalists are powerless against the frustration and indifference of the island's inhabitants. The environmental activist and passionate naturalist Roger Etcheberry lives on St. Pierre and Miquelon since childhood.Together with a Parisian botanist he explores the few pristine places on the archipelago and fights for their conservation.</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Africa's Creative Killers</title>
    <desc lang="hr">(Trenches, South Africa, 2015) On the plains of East Africa an epic journey is underway. Millions of wildebeest and thousands of zebras march in an annual, circular migration in search of lush grazing.Two major rivers, the Mara and the Grumeti, intersect their route and force the herds to cross. Crocodiles, the biggest living on earth, wait in these rivers to take advantage of this moving feast. In this ever-changing waterscape successful predators adapt their hunting strategies to suit the shifting environment.On the Grumeti River, DC is the Dominant Croc of a lose gang called the RagTags. When the wildebeest arrive to drink, these Pit Stops, Zone 1, are the crocs' first challenge. It doesn't go well for the RagTags. These smaller, inexperienced crocs don't calculate their launch speed correctly, so opportunities are missed. DC finds a pool where he can work alone. He grabs an impressive male zebra, but the pool's not deep enough to drown it. The zebra fights hard and DC is forced to let it go.Deep Water, Zone 2, is a zone exclusive to the Mara River. Steep banks and fast-flowing water make it a river that favours the crocodiles. Wildebeest plunge off the cliffs straight into the deep channel. To hunt here is easy: Swim, launch and drown.There's no free lunch on the Grumeti. DC waits for the next opportunity. He picks up vibrations in the water that tell him the herds have started to cross. Zone 3, The Shallows, is a dangerous zone for crocodiles. Wildebeest gallop across the river and crocodiles can get trampled. DC captures a calf but the RagTags share with him and DC is left with a single mouthful. Frustrated with his small portion, DC drives the gang away. Theft is a viable strategy in the Grumeti. The RagTags follow DC when he tries to hoard his next prize. When DC spots one of the gang members and gives chase, the RagTags move in and steal the carcass.DC finds another opportunity on the Rocks, Zone 4. Wildebeest are forced to walk slowly to avoid tripping and falling. DC causes panic in the ranks and grabs a calf.This time he won't share. He flicks the calf until the head tears right off the neck. Exhausted from the hunt, DC is forced to rest and recharge. He's not alone. This pool belongs to a hippopotamus. Luckily the hippo is more curious that confrontational and he leaves DC alone. As the season moves on, the Grumeti River dries up. Only the tail-enders of the herd remain and DC needs one last kill before the herds disappear for good.On the Mara River the water itself is so treacherous that many animals die while crossing. Carcasses pile up on the riverbank, and the crocs here can scavenge long after the wildebeest have left. DC will have to hunt if he wants a stockpile. When the herds unexpectedly drink at the hippo pool, DC sets up for a Pit Stop attack. But suddenly they start to cross and it becomes a Rock Crossing!Wildebeest trample over him but he strikes a big wildebeest bull and holds tight. The hippo pool is not deep enough for a quick death. But DC outlasts the wildebeest in the tug-of-war. 


The Mara and Grumeti are two very different hunting grounds that require unique skillsets from the crocodiles. In both these trenches the predators responded to the nuances of the landscape and triumphed.

At the Pit Stops and Rocks, in Deep and Shallow Water they learned to modify their hunting techniques – and thrived. And next year, when the herds return, these quiet waters will once again transform into Predator Zones.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(England, South Africa, 2010) The cheetah is a highly specialised animal. It excels at one thing alone, running down high-speed prey faster than any other mammal on earth.But this specialisation comes at a cost. The cheetah as a predatory model seems focussed on one single area of expertise. Outside of pursuing prey, how effective is this animal when compared to the other apex predators of the savannah?Alongside lions, leopards, vultures and hyenas how does the cheetah fit into the efficient cogs of the savannah system? Can it compete, or is it an outsider, cornered by it's own specialisation?The primary character in the story is a cheetah mother, who goes about her daily life, hunting for her three cubs. Her trials and tribulations highlight the refined hunting system of the cheetah, but they also shed light on her weaknesses, and the lack of robustness in the species itself.</desc>

To je srednjovjekovna nadgradnja, jedna od prvih gotičkih katedrala u povijesti, šira i viša od Notre-Dame u Parizu. U vrijeme kada je podignuta bila je najviša građevina na svijetu nakon piramida. U Chartresu je sve neuobičajeno: dimenzije, na primjer, ali i brzina gradnje. Kako se tako kolosalan pothvat mogao dovršiti za manje od 30 godina? Koja je tehnička revolucija omogućila Chartresu da ima tako ogromne vitraje, prisilivši Notre-Dame u Parizu da napravi veće? I kako je, nakon požara, gigantski okvir zamijenjen metalnom strukturom 40 godina prije izgradnje Eiffelovog tornja? Zahvaljujući ultra-realističnim računalno generiranim slikama i intervjuima sa stručnjacima za arhitekturu, otkrit ćete sve tajne Chartresa, katedrale bez premca koja je gotovo tisuću godina postizala jedan arhitektonski podvig za drugim, i koja još uvijek privlači više od milijun i pol posjetitelja godišnje.</desc>

Ovo je priča o istinskoj glazbenoj legendi; beskompromisni glazbenik s osjećajem rasnog ponosa koji je tijekom cijele svoje karijere pokazivao predanost mentorstvu nove generacije umjetnika, a predstavit će ekskluzivne doprinose ljudi čije je živote dotaknuo i koje nastavlja inspirirati, uključujući Herbieja Hancocka, Quincyja Jonesa, Billyja Joela, Ramseya Lewisa, Kelly Peterson i druge.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2019) Gilles Caron bio je na vrhuncu svoje karijere kao briljantni fotoreporter kada je nestao u Kambodži 1970. Imao je samo 30 godina. Kroz njegove kultne fotografije ovaj film, konstruiran kao istraga, ima za cilj vratiti fotografovu prisutnost, ispričati priču o njegovom pogledu i tome kako je u tako kratkom vremenu uspio pokriti svaki visoki sukob svog vremena.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Francuska, 2018) Irski nadbiskup iz 12. stoljeća Sveti Malahija napisao je tekst pod nazivom "Proročanstvo o papama" u kojem je predvidio kraj papinstva, uništenje Rima i sudnji dan. Je li to samo još jedna apokaliptična vizija? Još jedna priča o "kraju svijeta"? Vjerojatno nije. Tijekom gotovo 900 godina "Proročanstvo o papama" pokazalo se točnim. Čini se da je tim tekstom predviđena budućnost. U ovom dokumentarnom filmu provedena je istraga u Rimu, razgovarano je s brojnim stručnjacima, dok se u Vatikanu provjeravala točnost "Proročanstva o papama" nasuprot činjenica i događaja. Čini se da puno toga potvrđuje predviđanja Svetog Malahija.</desc>

Banda neofašističkih kriminalaca, predvođena samoproglašenim Nightom Slasherom (Brian Thompson), provaljuje u kuće i automobile, ubijajući ljude bez ikakvog povoda. Kada jedan od pripadnika bande pokuša orobiti maleni dućan, čije mušterije uzme kao taoce, na mjesto zločina je pozvan beskompromisni policajac Marion Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone), koji riješivši slučaj dolazi do korisnih informacija o Nightu Slasheru. Kasnije te noći, dođe do još jednog ubojstva, kojem svjedoči mlada Ingrid Knutsen (Brigitte Nielsen). Ingrid počinje dobivati brojne prijetnje, a jedini tko je može zaštiti upravo je Cobra.</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">(Hrvatska) Edukativni format domaće produkcije sastoji se od 20 epizoda, a svaka je posvećena jednom sportu. Voditelji serijala su Tatjana Gržan i Davor Balažin, dobro poznati voditelji RTL Kockice, kojima je ovo prvi zajednički serijal jer su se do sada uglavnom pojavljivali zasebno. Sada su proputovali cijelu Hrvatsku kako bi svojim gledateljima predstavili što više sportova. U Zagrebu su snimali skijanje, hokej, klizanje, gimnastiku, penjanje na umjetnim stjenama, badminton. Posjetili su i Rijeku, Pulu i Split. Na morskim lokacijama snimali su vodene sportove, atletiku, koturaljkanje, skejtanje.</desc>

Voditelji serijala su Tatjana Gržan i Davor Balažin, dobro poznati voditelji RTL Kockice, kojima je ovo prvi zajednički serijal jer su se do sada uglavnom pojavljivali zasebno. Sada su proputovali cijelu Hrvatsku kako bi svojim gledateljima predstavili što više sportova. U Zagrebu su snimali skijanje, hokej, klizanje, gimnastiku, penjanje na umjetnim stjenama, badminton. Posjetili su i Rijeku, Pulu i Split. Na morskim lokacijama snimali su vodene sportove, atletiku, koturaljkanje, skejtanje.</desc>

Kada njihova evropska trenerica skijanja Ana (30) objavi kako mogu otići u Evropu da bi intenzivno trenirale i postale licencirane instruktorice skijanja, čini se kao da su na korak od ostvarenja sna. Djevojke se pripremaju za put, dvije godine ulažući sve svoje napore u to. Međutim, kada dođu u Evropu, odmah se suočavaju s nepremostivim kulturnim preprekama i strogim standardima evropskog profesionalnog sporta. Dok se bore s razočaranjem, alternative dovode djevojke u iskušenje, uključujući i ilegalni odlazak u Njemačku. Prilika da ostvare svoje snove pretvara se u niz nepredvidljivih i emotivnih uspona i padova s visokim ulozima.</desc>

    <title lang="ba">Na kraju tame</title>
    <desc lang="ba">U rudniku Breza malo toga se promijenilo u posljednjih 50 godina. Uprkos prašini i mraku, 400 metara ispod površine rudari i dalje uživaju solidarnost i sigurnost posla kao u socijalističkoj Jugoslaviji. Nad zemljom novi poredak čine kapitalizam i individualnost. Film prati Sakibu, jednu od posljednjih rudarki koje rade u Brezi. Njen život pod zemljom ostatak je nekog drugog vremena, kada su kriza i nedostatak radne snage odvele žene u podzemlje, a vlade pokušavale unaprijediti položaj žena.Na svoj 50. rođendan Sakiba ima uvjete za penziju. Kada dođe na površinu i kaže zbogom tom specifičnom načinu života, hoće li iza sebe ostaviti i dio vlastitog identiteta? Film "Na kraju tame" istražuje šta znači biti rudar na kraju ere fosilnih goriva i šta znači biti žena u savremenoj Bosni i Hercegovini.</desc>

    <desc lang="ba">(Ostavština Milana Radoičića i Srpske liste na Kosovu) Ako postoje dani u kojima trebamo spoznati važnost istraživačkog novinarstva, upravo ih živimo. Era lažnih vijesti, brzih tehnologija i dostupnosti velike količine informacija pruža savršenu perspektivu za sakrivanje korupcije, zloupotrebe i neetičkog ponašanja. U takvim uvjetima nastala je emisija Al Jazeera Kodex. Ona zastupa građane koji nemaju glas, a na koje direktno utječe ovakvo ponašanje, te kroz lupu posmatra sve one koji u njihovo ime donose odluke i čije bi ponašanje moralo biti moralni i etički vodič.</desc>

V oddajo so si utirala pot alternativna politična razmišljanja, informacije in slikovni materiali, ki v drugih oddajah takratnega Informativnega programa še niso uspeli ugledati luči sveta.

S prostorom za zapiske, za misli, ki se utrnejo ob branju. Osnovni namen nove izdaje je vzpodbuditi bralce k prebiranju in razmišljanju o svetopisemskih modrostih na poglobljen način, pa tudi nagovoriti k preučevanju in pogovoru v skupini. Sinagoga Maribor spada med najstarejše srednjeveške še ohranjene sinagoge v srednjeevropskem prostoru. Že od 15. stoletja naprej ne služi več kot sakralni objekt. Danes v njej deluje Center judovske kulturne dediščine Sinagoga Maribor, ki z najrazličnejšimi kulturno-umetniškimi dogodki predstavlja bogato judovsko kulturno dediščino in teme, ki so povezane s holokavstom.</desc>

Na podlagi teh podatkov so izvedli sanacijo območja. Lani je vrednost nad 100 mg na liter imelo le še 4,5 odstotka otrok. Svinec je le ena izmed škodljivih snovi, ki smo jim vsak dan izpostavljeni: pesticidi, bisfenoli, ftalati, kadmij, parabeni, per- in polifluoroalkilne snovi … Strupene kemikalije lahko nastanejo tudi ob pripravi hrane.

Mladi obiskovalci so ob glasbeni pripovedi izvedeli, kako deluje orkester in kakšna je vloga dirigenta v njem, ter prisluhnili mladi nadarjeni glasbenici, violončelistki Katji Meljnikov, ki se je pri 16-ih letih že izobraževala na visoki glasbeni šoli in živela z glasbo. Karnevalsko vzdušje v dvorani so pričarale izvedbe naslednjih skladb: Uvertura iz Karnevala Antonina Dvořáka, Labod iz Živalskega karnevala Camilla Saint-Saënsa in Kurent slovenskega skladatelja Matije Bravničarja.</desc>

Mnoge secesijske arhitekturne stvaritve, ki so navdih iskale v folklornih motivih in geometrijskih oblikah ter se je z njimi meščanstvo želelo približati plemstvu, danes žal neslavno propadajo, so pa tudi takšne, ki so jih obnovili ali rekonstruirali. V eni od rekonstruiranih vil smo obiskali stanovanje, ki združuje tehnologije sedanjosti in utrip preteklosti. Pred nami je začetek študijskega leta. Stanovanje, ki ga bomo spoznali, je dober primer dobljene bitke za vsak centimeter - na svojih pičlih 20ih kvadratnih metrih ponuja namreč kopico rešitev, ki nudijo kvalitetno bivanje kar dvema študentoma. Kako v naravnem okolju zgraditi prostorno in izvirno hišo in hkrati ohraniti zemljišče čim bolj nedotaknjeno?

Tudi z najprestižnejšim - za najboljši film leta. Resnična zgodba o novinarjih, ki so za svojo raziskavo prejeli Pulitzerjevo nagrado, prikazuje dolgoletno delo skupine preiskovalcev časopisa Boston Globe, ki so se lotili razkrivanja obtožb o zlorabah mladoletnikov v katoliških ustanovah. Kljub pomanjkanju denarja in načrtnem zanikanju odgovornih se odločni novinarji prebijajo čez gore arhivskega gradiva in birokratskih ovir, razkritje resnice in prekinitev molka pa očrni najvišje predstavnike cerkve, pravnike in politike po vsem svetu.</desc>
