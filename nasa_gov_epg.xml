    <desc lang="en">The 1971 Apollo 14  Mission to Fra Mauro, a lunar highland area, is highlighted in this video. The mission’s primary goal was the collection of lunar rocks and soil samples and lunar exploration. The soil and rock sampling was for the geochronological determination of the Moon’s evolution and its comparison with that of Earth. A remote data collection station was assembled on the Moon and left for continuous data collection and surface monitoring experiments. The Apollo 14  astronauts were Alan B. Shepard, Edgar D. Mitchell, and Stuart A. Rossa. Astronauts Shepard and Mitchell landed on the Moon (February 5, 1971) and performed the sampling, the EVA, and deployment of the lunar experiments. There is film-footage of the lunar surface, of the command module’s approach to both the Moon and the Earth, Moon and Earth spacecraft launching and landing, in-orbit command- and lunar-module docking, and of Mission Control.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meet SWOT Mission Makers: Christine Gebara</title>
    <desc lang="en">A new video series highlights the hard work and passion of scientists and engineers who are helping to get this remarkable new satellite off the ground. As the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission finishes final preparations for its December launch, a new video series focuses on some of the engineers and scientists behind the satellite, which will be the first to observe nearly all water on Earth’s surface. Led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), SWOT will measure the height of water in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and the ocean. The SUV-size satellite will improve scientists’ ability to track the movement of water around the world while providing data that will help communities monitor and plan for changing water resources. In addition, the mission will boost scientists’ understanding of how sea level rise will affect coastlines around the world and the people who live near them. SWOT will also see ocean features too small for current space-based instruments to detect, improving researchers’ understanding of their role in climate change. More than a machine, SWOT is the culmination of years of work by a global team of engineers, scientists, and technicians committed to improving our understanding of our home planet. In this video series, you can meet team members from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the U.S. portion of the mission, and from the agency’s headquarters in Washington as they explain why working on SWOT means so much to them:
Cedric David, a hydrologist who studies the world’s rivers, shares how water is the only place he feels truly comfortable because of physical challenges. As Cedric notes, SWOT will provide a global picture of freshwater resources and help improve water management, which is why he is so proud to help make a difference in protecting this precious resource.
Christine Gebara, a mechanical engineer who helped test and integrate the spacecraft, tells the story of how she fell in love with engineering while learning to sail with the Girl Scouts on a lake near her childhood home in Houston. She reveals what inspires her most about building a spacecraft and offers advice for young women interested in engineering.
Tahani Amer, the mission’s program executive, recalls growing up near Cairo, where her father encouraged her to study math and science – an atypical pursuit for young women in Egypt at the time. Today, she oversees several NASA Earth science missions, including SWOT. In the video, Amer shares how she’s been inspired by her Islamic faith, her family, and her colleagues.
Marc Simard, a scientist who studies river deltas where they meet the ocean, discusses how he developed a passion for the environment in college, switching from a planned career in astrophysics to developing tools to study Earth. One of Simard’s favorite things about SWOT is that its data will help scientists better understand how sea level rise will affect coastal deltas around the world.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For generations, we have dreamed about a place to live and work in space...a space station. And right now, 260 miles above us, moving 5 miles a second...that dream is a reality. We dreamed that life up there would benefit life down here. That dream has come true. Can the research on board the space station lead to cleaner drinking water on Earth? Can it help farmers produce better crops? Can it inspire a generation of students? Can it even save a life? It already has. As the work aboard the International Space Station begins to reach its potential, the benefits to humanity are becoming evident. These are just a few of the stories from people who have benefitted....told in their own words.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">By any measure, the X-31 was a highly successful flight research program at NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center, now the Armstrong Flight Research Center. It regularly flew several flights a day, accumulating over 550 flights during the course of the program, with a superlative safety record. And yet, on Jan. 19, 1995, on the very last scheduled flight of the X-31 ship No. 1, disaster struck. Each mishap has it’s own set of circumstances and it’s own sequence of events. But those who study mishaps find similar issues: communications, complacency, unwarranted assumptions, human frailties….just like a chain. You make a chain -- a chain of events -- when you have any of these accidents. Any link of the chain, if broken, would prevent an accident. The X-31 flight test team was the "A" team -- the best people, from every discipline -- from every organization. But they lost an airplane. If it can happen to the best team, it can happen to any team.</desc>

We dreamed that life up there would benefit life down here. That dream has come true. Can the research on board the space station lead to cleaner drinking water on Earth? Can it help farmers produce better crops? Can it inspire a generation of students? Can it even save a life? It already has.

And yet, on Jan. 19, 1995, on the very last scheduled flight of the X-31 ship No. 1, disaster struck. Each mishap has it’s own set of circumstances and it’s own sequence of events.

    <title lang="en">Meet SWOT Mission Makers: Christine Gebara</title>
    <desc lang="en">A new video series highlights the hard work and passion of scientists and engineers who are helping to get this remarkable new satellite off the ground. As the international Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission finishes final preparations for its December launch, a new video series focuses on some of the engineers and scientists behind the satellite, which will be the first to observe nearly all water on Earth’s surface. Led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), SWOT will measure the height of water in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and the ocean. The SUV-size satellite will improve scientists’ ability to track the movement of water around the world while providing data that will help communities monitor and plan for changing water resources. In addition, the mission will boost scientists’ understanding of how sea level rise will affect coastlines around the world and the people who live near them. SWOT will also see ocean features too small for current space-based instruments to detect, improving researchers’ understanding of their role in climate change. More than a machine, SWOT is the culmination of years of work by a global team of engineers, scientists, and technicians committed to improving our understanding of our home planet. In this video series, you can meet team members from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the U.S. portion of the mission, and from the agency’s headquarters in Washington as they explain why working on SWOT means so much to them:
Cedric David, a hydrologist who studies the world’s rivers, shares how water is the only place he feels truly comfortable because of physical challenges. As Cedric notes, SWOT will provide a global picture of freshwater resources and help improve water management, which is why he is so proud to help make a difference in protecting this precious resource.
Christine Gebara, a mechanical engineer who helped test and integrate the spacecraft, tells the story of how she fell in love with engineering while learning to sail with the Girl Scouts on a lake near her childhood home in Houston. She reveals what inspires her most about building a spacecraft and offers advice for young women interested in engineering.
Tahani Amer, the mission’s program executive, recalls growing up near Cairo, where her father encouraged her to study math and science – an atypical pursuit for young women in Egypt at the time. Today, she oversees several NASA Earth science missions, including SWOT. In the video, Amer shares how she’s been inspired by her Islamic faith, her family, and her colleagues.
Marc Simard, a scientist who studies river deltas where they meet the ocean, discusses how he developed a passion for the environment in college, switching from a planned career in astrophysics to developing tools to study Earth. One of Simard’s favorite things about SWOT is that its data will help scientists better understand how sea level rise will affect coastal deltas around the world.</desc>

These balloons are used to conduct technology demonstration tests as well as scientific investigations in fields such as astrophysics, heliophysics and atmospheric research. Depending on the goals and objectives of a specific mission, balloon flight durations can run hours to multiple days or weeks for longer-term exposures and data collection. NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia manages the agency’s Scientific Balloon Program with 10 to 15 flights each year from launch sites worldwide. Northrop Grumman, which operates NASA’s Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF) in Texas, provides mission planning, engineering services and field operations for the program.

    <title lang="en">Creating Black Hole Jets With a NASA Supercomputer</title>
    <desc lang="en">NASA Goddard astrophysicists Ryan Tanner and Kim Weaver have used the NASA Center for Climate Simulation’s Discover supercomputer to simulate weak jets produced by monster black holes, which can weigh up to billions of times the Sun’s mass. As matter falls toward the black hole, some of it accelerates to near light speed and diverts into a narrow pair of jets flowing in opposite directions. In the grandest examples, these jets extend hundreds of thousands of light-years and are easily detected features in radio. But weaker jets, which are more difficult to detect, can greatly impact the central regions of their host galaxies. Astronomers suspected weak jets might be responsible for unusual gas motions or otherwise unexplainable optical and X-ray emission in some black-hole-powered galaxies. So Tanner and Weaver simulated weak jets under realistic conditions for a galaxy about the mass of our own Milky Way. To represent the gas distribution and properties related to the black hole’s activity, they referenced spiral galaxies such as NGC 1386, NGC 3079, and NGC 4945. Tanner modified existing astrophysical hydrodynamics code to explore how the jets and the gas impact each other across 26,000 light-years of space, or about a quarter the diameter of the Milky Way, and 600,000 years of time. From the full set of 100 simulations, the team selected 19 – which consumed 800,000 core hours on Discover – for publication. The final form of these outflows depends mainly on their interactions with large, dense gas clouds in the galaxy’s central region. These clouds can disrupt, deflect, split, or even suppress the jet. This atlas of simulations provides an important touchstone for better understanding how weaker, less apparent jets modify their galaxies.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Creating Black Hole Jets With a NASA Supercomputer</title>
    <desc lang="en">NASA Goddard astrophysicists Ryan Tanner and Kim Weaver have used the NASA Center for Climate Simulation’s Discover supercomputer to simulate weak jets produced by monster black holes, which can weigh up to billions of times the Sun’s mass. As matter falls toward the black hole, some of it accelerates to near light speed and diverts into a narrow pair of jets flowing in opposite directions. In the grandest examples, these jets extend hundreds of thousands of light-years and are easily detected features in radio. But weaker jets, which are more difficult to detect, can greatly impact the central regions of their host galaxies. Astronomers suspected weak jets might be responsible for unusual gas motions or otherwise unexplainable optical and X-ray emission in some black-hole-powered galaxies. So Tanner and Weaver simulated weak jets under realistic conditions for a galaxy about the mass of our own Milky Way. To represent the gas distribution and properties related to the black hole’s activity, they referenced spiral galaxies such as NGC 1386, NGC 3079, and NGC 4945. Tanner modified existing astrophysical hydrodynamics code to explore how the jets and the gas impact each other across 26,000 light-years of space, or about a quarter the diameter of the Milky Way, and 600,000 years of time. From the full set of 100 simulations, the team selected 19 – which consumed 800,000 core hours on Discover – for publication. The final form of these outflows depends mainly on their interactions with large, dense gas clouds in the galaxy’s central region. These clouds can disrupt, deflect, split, or even suppress the jet. This atlas of simulations provides an important touchstone for better understanding how weaker, less apparent jets modify their galaxies.</desc>

To represent the gas distribution and properties related to the black hole’s activity, they referenced spiral galaxies such as NGC 1386, NGC 3079, and NGC 4945. Tanner modified existing astrophysical hydrodynamics code to explore how the jets and the gas impact each other across 26,000 light-years of space, or about a quarter the diameter of the Milky Way, and 600,000 years of time. From the full set of 100 simulations, the team selected 19 – which consumed 800,000 core hours on Discover – for publication. The final form of these outflows depends mainly on their interactions with large, dense gas clouds in the galaxy’s central region. These clouds can disrupt, deflect, split, or even suppress the jet. This atlas of simulations provides an important touchstone for better understanding how weaker, less apparent jets modify their galaxies.</desc>

    <title lang="en">B-Line to Space: The Scientific Balloon Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">B-Line to Space: The Scientific Balloon Story is about NASA’s scientific balloons, which offer low-cost, near-space access for suspended payloads weighing up to 8,000 pounds. These balloons are used to conduct technology demonstration tests as well as scientific investigations in fields such as astrophysics, heliophysics and atmospheric research. Depending on the goals and objectives of a specific mission, balloon flight durations can run hours to multiple days or weeks for longer-term exposures and data collection. NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia manages the agency’s Scientific Balloon Program with 10 to 15 flights each year from launch sites worldwide. Northrop Grumman, which operates NASA’s Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF) in Texas, provides mission planning, engineering services and field operations for the program. The CSBF team has launched more than 1,700 scientific balloons in the over 35 years of operation.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Creating Black Hole Jets With a NASA Supercomputer</title>
    <desc lang="en">NASA Goddard astrophysicists Ryan Tanner and Kim Weaver have used the NASA Center for Climate Simulation’s Discover supercomputer to simulate weak jets produced by monster black holes, which can weigh up to billions of times the Sun’s mass. As matter falls toward the black hole, some of it accelerates to near light speed and diverts into a narrow pair of jets flowing in opposite directions. In the grandest examples, these jets extend hundreds of thousands of light-years and are easily detected features in radio. But weaker jets, which are more difficult to detect, can greatly impact the central regions of their host galaxies. Astronomers suspected weak jets might be responsible for unusual gas motions or otherwise unexplainable optical and X-ray emission in some black-hole-powered galaxies. So Tanner and Weaver simulated weak jets under realistic conditions for a galaxy about the mass of our own Milky Way. To represent the gas distribution and properties related to the black hole’s activity, they referenced spiral galaxies such as NGC 1386, NGC 3079, and NGC 4945. Tanner modified existing astrophysical hydrodynamics code to explore how the jets and the gas impact each other across 26,000 light-years of space, or about a quarter the diameter of the Milky Way, and 600,000 years of time. From the full set of 100 simulations, the team selected 19 – which consumed 800,000 core hours on Discover – for publication. The final form of these outflows depends mainly on their interactions with large, dense gas clouds in the galaxy’s central region. These clouds can disrupt, deflect, split, or even suppress the jet. This atlas of simulations provides an important touchstone for better understanding how weaker, less apparent jets modify their galaxies.</desc>
