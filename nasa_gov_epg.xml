NASA is researching what ride quality could be like for passengers traveling in eVTOL aircraft, to make sure it is a smooth and safe ride. In this episode of NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility Playbook, RVLT Project Flight Dynamics and Control Technical Lead Carlos Malpica explains why NASA is uniquely qualified for this research and why it’s important to the future of flight.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Color of Space captures the personal stories of seven current and former Black astronauts, each selected to become part of NASA’s astronaut corps and train for space missions. Current NASA astronauts Stephanie Wilson, Victor Glover, Jeanette Epps, as well as retired astronauts Leland Melvin, Bernard Harris, Robert Curbeam, and Bobby Satcher, speak about their journeys and their motivations in a panel hosted by NASA Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche, the first Black woman to lead a NASA center. They took the step to achieve the impossible, overcoming barriers and making space for others to follow. In this new documentary, be empowered by the remarkable stories of tenacity, courage, and motivation from the agency’s most decorated heroes. Learn about their path to NASA, their sources of inspiration, experiences in space, the importance of representation, the meaning of Juneteenth, and much more. Originally held at Space Center Houston on March 25, the panel discussion marks the first time the seven astronauts have been assembled for an official NASA event.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our guest is Dr. Henderson ”Jim” Cleaves! Jim studies the origin of life on Earth and its potential beyond, specifically asking the question: how does chemistry become biology? He is interested in how organic compounds are produced from cosmically-abundant, inorganic compounds, and how these compounds self-organize to form more complex and potentially self-replicating systems. Dr. Cleaves is a member of ISSOL, The International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, an international astrobiology society; a senior research investigator at Blue Marble Space Institute of Science; and a professor of chemistry at Howard University.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this series, we dive into the legacy of Goddard’s lead role in developing laser altimetry, which has revolutionized the way we map our planet, the Moon and other planets. Each chapter looks at the successes and failures of these lidar instruments, beginning with the Mars Observer Laser Altimeter in the late 1980s, through the current generation of laser altimeters on ICESat-2 and GEDI. Through dozens of interviews and archival footage, the history, challenges and legacy of lidar are uncovered.</desc>
