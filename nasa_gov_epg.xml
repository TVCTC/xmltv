    <title lang="en">New Horizons - Summiting the Solar System</title>
    <desc lang="en">Summiting the Solar System is a story of exploration at its most ambitious and extreme. On January 1, 2019, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flies by a small Kuiper Belt Object known scientifically as 2014 MU69, but nicknamed ”Ultima Thule.” Ultima is four billion miles from Earth, and will be the most ancient and most distant world ever explored close up. It is expected to offer discoveries about the origin and evolution of our solar system. Chosen by the team and the public, the nickname honors the mythical land beyond the edges of the known world. But ”Summiting” is much more than the story of a sophisticated, plutonium-fueled robotic spacecraft exploring far from the Sun. The New Horizons mission is powered as much by the passions of a small team of humans—men and women, scientists and engineers—for whom pushing the frontiers of the known, climbing the very peaks of the possible, has been the dream of many decades.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Color of Space: Charlie Bolden</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Color of Space captures the personal stories of seven current and former Black astronauts, each selected to become part of NASA’s astronaut corps and train for space missions. Current NASA astronauts Stephanie Wilson, Victor Glover, Jeanette Epps, as well as retired astronauts Leland Melvin, Bernard Harris, Robert Curbeam, and Bobby Satcher, speak about their journeys and their motivations in a panel hosted by NASA Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche, the first Black woman to lead a NASA center. They took the step to achieve the impossible, overcoming barriers and making space for others to follow. In this new documentary, be empowered by the remarkable stories of tenacity, courage, and motivation from the agency’s most decorated heroes. Learn about their path to NASA, their sources of inspiration, experiences in space, the importance of representation, the meaning of Juneteenth, and much more. Originally held at Space Center Houston on March 25, the panel discussion marks the first time the seven astronauts have been assembled for an official NASA event.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New Horizons is the first mission to the Kuiper Belt, a giant zone of icy bodies and mysterious small objects orbiting beyond Neptune. This region also known as the ”Third” zone of our solar system, beyond the inner rocky planets and outer gas giants. John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, in Maryland, designed, built and operates the Bew Horizons space craft and manages the mission for NASA’s Science Missions directorate in Washington. The Year of Pluto - NASA New Horizon is a one hour documentary that takes on the hard science and gives us the answers to how the mission came about and why it matters.
