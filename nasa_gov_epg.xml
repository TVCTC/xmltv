    <desc lang="en">NASA’s vision for Advanced Air Mobility, or AAM, is to map out a safe, accessible, and affordable new air transportation system alongside industry partners, community partners and the FAA. NASA is researching what ride quality could be like for passengers traveling in eVTOL aircraft, to make sure it is a smooth and safe ride. In this episode of NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility Playbook, RVLT Project Flight Dynamics and Control Technical Lead Carlos Malpica explains why NASA is uniquely qualified for this research and why it’s important to the future of flight.</desc>
