    <desc lang="en">New Horizons is the first mission to the Kuiper Belt, a giant zone of icy bodies and mysterious small objects orbiting beyond Neptune. This region also known as the ”Third” zone of our solar system, beyond the inner rocky planets and outer gas giants. John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, in Maryland, designed, built and operates the Bew Horizons space craft and manages the mission for NASA’s Science Missions directorate in Washington. The Year of Pluto - NASA New Horizon is a one hour documentary that takes on the hard science and gives us the answers to how the mission came about and why it matters. New Horizons is part of the New Frontiers Program managed by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.</desc>
