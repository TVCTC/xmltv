    <desc lang="en">The Color of Space captures the personal stories of seven current and former Black astronauts, each selected to become part of NASA’s astronaut corps and train for space missions. Current NASA astronauts Stephanie Wilson, Victor Glover, Jeanette Epps, as well as retired astronauts Leland Melvin, Bernard Harris, Robert Curbeam, and Bobby Satcher, speak about their journeys and their motivations in a panel hosted by NASA Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche, the first Black woman to lead a NASA center. They took the step to achieve the impossible, overcoming barriers and making space for others to follow. In this new documentary, be empowered by the remarkable stories of tenacity, courage, and motivation from the agency’s most decorated heroes. Learn about their path to NASA, their sources of inspiration, experiences in space, the importance of representation, the meaning of Juneteenth, and much more. Originally held at Space Center Houston on March 25, the panel discussion marks the first time the seven astronauts have been assembled for an official NASA event.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The “scattered factory” expands. This journey recounts how, among abandoned buildings, mines transformed into tourist attractions, factories in Eastern Europe that have been reconverted to produce Italian cars, and the transformation of industrial cities and towns such as Sesto San Giovanni (the former Stalingrad of Italy) and Lumezzane (the “workshop” city of the Brescia area). The places, the images, the sounds. The director takes note and recounts by blending telephone calls, conferences, poems, old movies, commercials on Yugoslavian TV, Russian ballets, experimental performances. One sole flow that expands into multiple senses and directions. Just like a factory.</desc>
