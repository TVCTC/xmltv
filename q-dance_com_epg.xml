                Hardstyle is an electronic dance music genre with a tempo of 140-150 BPM. It has influences of both hardcore and house music and the beats per minute lie exactly between these two. Several subgenres have developed over the years, such as raw style and terror. The hard sound of the first years are now often referred to as early hardstyle. Hardstyle is an accessible genre because of all the subgenres. Hardcore, freestyle, euphoric, uptempo or extra raw? There is one for everybody. 
                Most of the time the artists choose to focus on one specific style, but they also often experiment. Leading artists of the euphoric style are for instance Brennan Heart, Noisecontrollers and Wildstylez. Popular hardcore and early hardcore artists are Nosferatu, Angerfist, Mad Dog and The Viper. Leading raw and extra raw artists are Radical Redemption, Warface, Requiem and Delete. Popular freestyle artists are Paul Elstak, Darkraver and Vince.
